What you can use do with this code:

- Learn from it. Want to know how I did something, feel free to dig through the code.
- Copying **parts** of this codebase, with attribution.

What you shouldn't do with this code:

- Copy the whole codebase. There are plenty of [11ty starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) which are available - use those instead.
- Fork the repository. You don't need your own copy of **my** site. That's creepy. If you want an 11ty site, use a [starter project](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) and build your own.
