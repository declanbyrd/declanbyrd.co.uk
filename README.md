Hi.

I appreciate that you liked the code for my website and it's cool that you want to reference it as an example.

However, this is my personal site. The photos, notes, posts, stylesheets, are all things that I've made. Having a fork of this project means that you have a copy of these things and I would rather you didn't.

I keep the source of my website open so that others can see how I've built it and use parts as inspiration for their own sites. I don’t keep the source open so my website can be used as a template (there are lots of community made templates for 11ty that are a much better starting point). I believe that being able to see the pre-built source is a great way of learning and I'd rather not prevent others from having that opportunity with my own site. I’ve also asked nicely in the README for you to not fork this project.

Therefore, I’m asking if you would please delete this fork of my personal website. It is still available for reference on Github under my username and can be added to a list if you’d like to bookmark it for later.

Thanks for your understanding.

Declan
