    alt: The eastern side of La Concha beach in San Sebastián. The tide is out which exposes the gold coloured sand. Above the sea wall which lines the beach is San Sebastián city hall. Behind the city hall is the old town of San Sebastián which is overlooked by the tree covered hill of Monte Urgull. At the top of Monte Urgull is a statue of Jesus.
