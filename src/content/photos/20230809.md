    alt: A fox sleeping on a flat roof. Half of the fox is covered by the sunlight that is coming over the rooftop to the left of the fox. The fox's left ear is pointed upwards while it's right ear is layed flat to the rooftop. Out of focus on the light brown tiled rooftop behind the fox is an onlooking seagull.
