Another four runs this week. Like last week, only one of these runs was at a pace that was close to my goal pace for a 5km run. The remaining runs were at a much slower pace taking either 20 or 40 minutes. I felt good after all the runs this week, which I am really pleased with. The weather could have been nicer on a couple of those runs though - got a bit damp.

A little bit of time was spent playing Horizon Forbidden West on the PlayStation. I managed to complete the first cauldron and a couple of side quests.

The European championship football kicked off this week, and normally I'd be watching every game regardless of who was playing. I watched three out of the seven games that were played, and I can't say I was that interested in watching the games.
