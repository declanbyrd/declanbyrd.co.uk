Monday was a public holiday in the UK, so I used the additional day off work to finish the main story in Horizon Zero Dawn on the PlayStation. What a game, and a great story. I was surprised that I managed to spend 53 hours playing, which is almost double the time I spent playing Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.

No basketball games this week, but I had a session on Thursday. My brother decided he wanted to come along this week despite having not played for six years. He borrowed a pair of my old basketball shoes, since his last pair were now too small. I struggled in this session and took longer than usual to warm up when we started playing.

On Saturday, I was at the American Express stadium to watch [Brighton lose 3-0 against Arsenal in the Premier League](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3954571/albion-punished-by-ruthless-arsenal). That's pretty much put an end to Brighton's season - they likely won't qualify for Europe again, they won't get relegated, and a mid-table finish feels a bit underwhelming given the success of last season.

On Sunday, I was in Brighton to watch a friend run the marathon. They did very well and finished in a time they were happy with. I quite enjoyed the challenge of maximising the number of places on the route where we could cheer them on, while remaining at a walking pace. I got back quite late, so these notes have been a bit rushed.
