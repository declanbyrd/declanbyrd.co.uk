This was my first five day working week since the end of November. Definitely feeling drained at the end of this week.

I had a basketball game this week, playing in Worthing D&D White's home loss to Worthing D&D Black. This game was rescheduled from December where the game got cancelled mid-way through the third quarter. I didn't play as well as I know I can and struggled to adjust to the pace of the game after long periods sat on the bench.

I spent the weekend car shopping. The intention wasn't to buy a car this weekend - I just wanted to see what kind of car I would like when I did have to buy a new one. After a test drive in a Toyota Aygo and concluding that the car was too cramped, I ended up test driving a larger car at a different dealership and signing some paperwork to purchase that car.
