I started playing Horizon Forbidden West on the PlayStation 5 this week. Its often convenient in sequels that the main character can just forget everything they learnt in the previous game while also losing everything that they had in their inventory, so it was nice that Forbidden West acknowledges the skills that were learnt and the existence of cauldrons from Zero Dawn. The 15 hours of play that I've managed so far have not been spent progressing the story, although I have chosen to ignore some of the side quests like the hunting grounds and the board game that can be played.

I had been looking forward to getting back into a running routine this week. But I got a cold, my tonsils had swollen, and I couldn't go 5 minutes without sneezing. Hopefully I'll be back running next week.
