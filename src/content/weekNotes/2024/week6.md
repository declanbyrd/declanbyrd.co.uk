I was supposed to have a basketball game this week for Worthing D&D White against East Grinstead Flyers but the game was cancelled. We would have only travelled with six players and one was carrying an injury. I was looking forward to playing, but I was also grateful that I could have an early night.

My own rule of writing a journal post for each change that I want to make for this website, has frustrated me slightly this week. I've found I'm writing more, but not making as much progress as I would like to. I'm currently writing about the process of adding an introduction paragraph to my website and while the end result should only be a couple of paragraphs, I've written more about the process than the introduction itself.

On Saturday, I travelled to London to watch [Brighton lose 2-1 against Tottenham Hotspur at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3888498). Gutting to lose the game by conceding a last minute goal. The best part of the day was the stir fried Leghmen that I had at [Etles Uyghur restaurant in Walthamstow](https://etleswalthamstow.com/) before the game.
