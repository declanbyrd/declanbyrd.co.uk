On Tuesday I had a basketball game for Worthing D&D White, [losing 69-56 against Worthing D&D Black](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/35866850.html). I didn't have a great game, but managed to make a three-point shot despite not seeing much of the ball.

I had another basketball game on Thursday this week, [losing 97-66 against Brighton Cougars](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/35866895.html). This game was much more frustrating to play in. I made the mistake of making lots of shots in the warmup which resulted in the opposition team guarding me much higher up the court. I've got one speed and its slow, so I found it really difficult to receive the ball. When I did get the ball, I shot really badly - not making any of my 9 shot attempts.

Writing my notes early this week because I'm travelling for work over the weekend. This meant most of my Saturday was spent overpacking a suitcase to appease my anxiety levels, and then hours of deliberating over which items I could probably leave behind.

This week, I wrote these notes as normal on my laptop but I'm updating them on my phone in the GitHub mobile app. I created a pull request before I left so that I can merge it when my notes are finished.

## What has changed on this site:

- Halved the cache duration from 24 hours to 12 hours for the response from the fetch call that I make to get the video game that I'm currently playing.

## What I've been reading

- I started and read nearly 300 pages of [Eye of the Sh*t Storm by Jackson Ford](/reading#now) this week.

## What I've been watching:

- [Episode 4 in season 17 of Taskmaster](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/63404/season/17/episode/4).
