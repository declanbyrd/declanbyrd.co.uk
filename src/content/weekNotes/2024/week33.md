Only three completed runs this week. Two runs of 35 minutes at a slow pace, and one longer run of 40 minutes at a slow paced followed by 10 minutes at a faster pace. I felt good in all the runs I completed and didn't have any problems. My training plan included a fourth run, though I wasn't able to fit it in over the weekend.

Two basketball sessions this week. I don't think I have ever had as good a session as the first of these. Every time I shot the ball it went in, and that included a buzzer beater from half court. I wasn't quite as accurate in the second session but still played very well. I also found that I was starting to benefit from the longer runs that I had been doing, as I was able to play at a faster pace for longer than I would have previously.

This week I've been thinking about routines. I started writing about the positive and negative thoughts that I have about routines, though this didn't progress further than a draft. I might look to revisit this, even if it exists as some rough notes without a more polished write up.

Anticipating that Saturday was going to be a busy day, I took the day off work on Friday. Becka and I spent the day in Brighton and tried to make the most of the nice weather.

I was up very early on Saturday to make the long journey north to Goodison Park to watch Brighton win 3-0 against Everton. It was a very entertaining game of football. I was surprised how well Brighton played given that the pre-season games were possibly too easy, and that there had been a large turnover of both players and coaches since the end of last season. This was my first and (pending any cup games) last trip to Goodison Park as Everton are moving to a new stadium for next season.

Of the 12 hours I was on the coach, I think I must have been asleep for at least 9 hours, but I can't verify this as my watch claims I didn't have any naps. Somehow I still felt very tired for the rest of the weekend.
