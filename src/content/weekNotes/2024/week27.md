I completed four runs this week. I modified the running plan that I had so that I was only doing "easy" runs this week. I felt good after all the shorter runs which lasted 30 minutes, though the longer run of 50 minutes resulted in some nasty blisters and a reminder to buy new socks. I also set a new personal best over a 5km distance which I was surprised about as all my runs are at a target pace as opposed to distance. At least I know I will be setting a new personal best when the pace guidelines start to get faster.

If I wasn't doing enough running already this week, I also had two basketball sessions. I enjoyed both, and thought I played well. I was expecting to feel shattered afterwards, but I felt good. Session were also busier this week. 

On Wednesday, I attended a work event at the Olympic park in London. We were split into teams, sent on a GPS based scavenger hunt around the Olympic park, and then went for pizza after. It was a good opportunity to meet other UK based colleagues. My social battery was very much empty after this.

On Thursday, I voted in the UK general election. While I feel like I should have been excited that the candidate I voted for won their seat, and their party are the new government, I mostly felt relief that the previous government are gone. 

I spent some time over the weekend working on a new feature for [eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive). I added the option to remove Mastodon hashtags from the post content if they are at the end of the post, and replace them with the tag name if they are located in the post content. I published this to npm as an alpha version so that I can test it out on my own site before eventually releasing it in v0.3.0.

## What has changed on this site:

- I'm now using `eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive@0.3.0-alpha.2` which removes Mastodon hash-tags from the post content.

## What I've been reading:

- I started reading [Death's End by Cixin Liu](/reading#now) this week.
- I finished reading [The Radleys by Matt Haig](/reading/9781847679161/).

## What I've been watching:

- [Episodes 1-3 in season 1 of The Acolyte](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/114479/season/1).
