No basketball for me this week, as the schools are using the sports halls for exams.

I've been playing a bit more of Horizon Zero Dawn on the PlayStation. There are a lot of distractions from the main story objectives so I haven't progressed the story very far. Still enjoying the game though.

On Saturday, I was at the American Express stadium to watch [Brighton draw 1-1 with Everton](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3908717/dunk-rises-to-the-occasion-to-earn-albion-a-point). A somewhat frustrating game, given how much pressure Brighton applied in the first half. It was noticeable that the longer Brighton went without scoring, the louder the Everton supporters were - sensing that their team could find a way to win the game.

Its been nice this week to finish work and it not be dark outside.
