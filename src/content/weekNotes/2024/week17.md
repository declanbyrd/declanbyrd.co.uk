I was in Tallinn (Estonia) this week to visit my work colleagues. The team has grown since the last time we all met, so it was good to meet some of the newer members of the team in-person.

I woke up on Tuesday to thick snow outside the hotel I was staying in. I managed to shuffle my way to the office through the snow, taking a bit of time to adjust to the lack of grip that my trainers had on the snow. I only had one moment where I lost my balance and nearly fell over. According to my smartwatch, this moment gained me 30 heart points.

My social battery drained very quickly this week and I struggled through the team social activities after work.

Unlike my previous trips to Tallinn, I managed to book a return flight that didn't require a connecting flight. It was much nicer not having to run through any airports and being able to have a long nap on the plane.

I travelled straight from the airport to the American Express stadium in time to watch [Brighton lose 4-0 to Manchester City](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3982686/manchester-city-too-strong-for-albion). A frustrating game to watch.

Exhausted by the end of the week. I would have gone to sleep earlier at the weekend, but I stayed up to watch some of the NBA play-off games.
