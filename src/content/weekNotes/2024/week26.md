Unlike recent weeks, I only managed three runs this week. Two easy runs of 40 minutes at a slow pace, and one run that was high pace intervals. I opted to skip the run scheduled for Saturday morning as this was another mile time trial and I didn't feel confident that I could replicate my time from last week.

I was back playing basketball this week. I thought I had a good session, and definitely felt the benefit from all the running I've been doing. My legs were very sore the next day though. Normally the first session back after the season ends is over-subscribed, but this session only just had enough players to play 5 v 5.

I started a new side project over the weekend to scratch a creative itch. Most of the time I start projects like this one, I struggle with the scope and quickly lose interest before abandoning the idea altogether. For this project, there isn't a lot of technical work so I'm hoping this helps to keep the scope defined.
