I completed 4 runs this week. Two slow paced runs of 35 minutes each, a two mile time-trial that I finished inside 19 minutes, and a tempo run that involved running at my 5km goal pace for 8 minutes followed by 3 minutes of jogging and then repeated twice. My training plan assumes that I am preparing for a race (which I don't intend to do), so I'm always demotivated when the training plan consists of time trial runs. While its proof to myself that I am able to run faster since I started the plan, they are also my least favourite types of runs. I know I can skip these runs and replace them with slow paced runs instead but this also defeats the purpose of having a training plan.

Two basketball sessions this week, and I struggled in both for very different reasons. The first session was very physical and resulted in a few too many bruises. I was still able to make a few three point shots but that got progressively harder as the session went on. The second session probably shouldn't have gone ahead as the roof was leaking (again). Instead of only having to be aware of the other players on the court, I also had to be aware of the four (completely soaked) towels that had been placed on the court where the roof was leaking. It made it all the more challenging trying to play when you couldn't always see where the towels are.

On Saturday, I was at the American Express stadium to watch Brighton win 2-1 against Manchester United. Always a great feeling when your team scores a 90th minute winner, and to do so against a good Manchester United side was even better. Its going to be exciting when all the new signings are integrated into the squad.

I've been playing Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga on the PlayStation this week. I forgot how different the open world levels are from the original Lego Star Wars games, and I much prefer the depth of the original levels. The open world makes it easier to play for short periods of time without having to remember what I was doing the last time I played.

## What has changed on this site:

- On iOS, the book covers for the books I have read were unintentionally distorted. I updated the CSS to change the width property so that it respects the defined aspect-ratio property.
