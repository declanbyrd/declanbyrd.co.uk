description: Notes for the third week of 2024.

On Tuesday, I had a basketball game for [Worthing D&D White against Brighton Cougars](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/35866713.html). Despite being on the losing side, I thought I had a good game, making two three-point shots.

I made a start on one of the items in the 2024 to-do list, and I started writing about adding a more human introduction to my site's homepage. As the outcome of this is will likely be something that I iterate on in the future, I'm trying to document as much of my thinking as possible.

Not much else to write about here this week.

## What has changed on this site:

- I published the [first iteration of my 2024 to-do list](/journal/2024/room-for-improvement/).

## What I've been reading:

- I read a chapter of [Artificial Wisdom by Thomas R. Weaver](/reading/#now).

- [Episodes 3-5 in season 1 of Echo](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/122226-echo/season/1).
