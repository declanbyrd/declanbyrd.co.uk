Another four runs completed this week. I had my now usual two short runs in addition to one longer run. My training plan included a sprint workout which I decided I didn't want to attempt, so I completed another short run instead. The long run had previously included an optional 10 minutes at the same pace as the rest of the run, but this week the optional 10 minutes was at a faster pace and I hadn't realised until my watch started beeping about me going too slow. I learned my lesson to read all the steps for the run before leaving the house so I'm prepared to go faster if the instructions tell me to.

Only one basketball session this week. I thought I played well, though my legs felt like they stopped working at some points as a result of the long run that I completed earlier that day. Unlike last week, I wasn't struggling to shoot the ball and made a few three point shots. I missed the second scheduled session, but it got cancelled anyway as the sports hall roof was still leaking.

I was at the American Express Stadium on Saturday to watch Brighton win 4-0 against Villareal in a pre-season friendly. It was maybe a bit too easy for the final pre-season game and its probably installed blind confidence in the team before the first Premier League game next weekend. I won't link to the club's match report as they decided to re-design their website so that every article is now a modal (which makes it harder to share individual articles), and they decided to remove the RSS feed. Not impressed with the website re-design so far.

Prior to the football, there was also a trip to the Harvey's brewery in Lewes for the [Triple Alliance beer festival](https://www.harveys.org.uk/news/tripel-alliance-beer-festival-harveys). I had some nice beers from Burning Sky Brewery, Brasserie de la Senne, and Harvey's.

I completed the story for the first World of Goo game. I originally played it on the Wii, though never completed it. So I downloaded the mobile version and also never got around to completing that. But then I downloaded the version for Windows this week when I also purchased World of Goo 2, and I finally know what happens at the end of the game now. I'm looking forward to playing World of Goo 2.

## What has changed on this site:

- No changes this week.

## What I've been reading:

- Read a few pages from [Doppelganger by Naomi Klein](/reading#now) this week. Very unlikely to finish it before the library loan expires, and I've found it really difficult to get into.

## What I've been watching:

- [Season 4 of The Umbrella Academy](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/75006/season/4).
- Olympics coverage.
