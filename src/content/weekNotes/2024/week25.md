I managed to complete another four runs this week. Two of these were slower paced "easy" runs, one was to run at my 5km goal pace over short distances, and the other was to run a mile as fast as I could. The 5km goal pace run I found very challenging as I struggled to adapt to the new pace guidelines and often got prompted to slow down. I was very happy with my mile time though - 8 minutes 43 seconds. My average pace was over 30 seconds faster per kilometre than my 5km goal pace.

I did a large refactoring of my the content management application that I built for my personal website. I dislike calling it a content management application and would rather have a better term for it but unfortunately I don't. I rewrote the application using Preact and Vite, updated the node.js version that the serverless functions use which helped remove a couple of dependencies, and added a serverless function so I can publish longer blog posts to my website. By taking a quick glance at the journal page, you can see I've not really utilised the application at all, but I hope to at some point.

I watched most of the European championship football games this week. Fell asleep during a couple too.
