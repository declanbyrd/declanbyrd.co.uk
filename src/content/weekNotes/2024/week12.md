No basketball for me this week. I was due to have a game on Tuesday against Worthing D&D black, but the game was cancelled a couple of hours before it was supposed to start. Unfortunately the sports hall roof was leaking and the heavy rain meant that there were puddles underneath each basket.

Spent significant hours trying to locate an image of every pair of basketball shoes that I've played in, and then [wrote about it](/journal/2024/basketball-shoes/). This was much harder than I had anticipated and as a result I gave up trying to find some pairs. Thinking about using this collection to create themes that can be applied to this site.

Becka needed to visit Manchester for work, and I got to tag along. So I spent most of the weekend travelling to and from Manchester on the train. I did get to have a bit of an explore while I was there, though most of this was on Sunday when it had stopped raining. Managed to get a lot of reading done while I was on the train too.

## What has changed on this site:

- `p-summary` for all my journal posts now have a value that is not undefined.
- The description meta tag previously had a name of "Description" so I've now made sure it is lower cased.

## What I've been reading

- I finished reading [Artificial Wisdom by Thomas R Weaver](/reading/9781739434304/).
- I started reading [Upgrade by Blake Crouch](/reading#now).

## What I've been watching:

- [Season 1 of 3 Body Problem](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/108545/season/1).
- [Black Bear (2020)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/624788).
