I managed a lot of reading this week. I've got into the habit of picking up my e-reader instead of my phone when I have free time. It helps knowing the time it will take me to finish a chapter when making the decision between reading and doing something else.



On Sunday, I played in the Basketball Sussex & Surrey Plate final for Worthing D&D White against Bognor GSD.

## What has changed on this site:

- I removed the summary and description elements from book pages. They were supposed to contain a brief summary about the book, but they more often than not only listed the awards that the book was listed for. Since this came from Google books and I would have to update these manually, I opted to remove them.
- Book covers now have an aspect ration of 10/16 so they are all the same size.

## What I've been reading

- I finished [The Last Devil To Die by Richard Osman](/reading/9780241992418/).
