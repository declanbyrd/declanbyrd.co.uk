Only one basketball session this week. The sports hall has a leaky roof, and it rained heavily on the day of a session. A bucket had been placed under one of the baskets, and if it had continued to rain the condition of the court would not get better, so I opted not to attend. Thankfully the weather was dry for the second session and I thought I played well. We were low on numbers so a few of the under 18s players stayed behind after their session had finished.

I managed three runs this week, though I was only to complete the scheduled workout on two of these. Two runs were slow paced easy runs which I felt very comfortable running. And then there was the run I wasn't able to finish. The required pace was over a minute faster than the easy runs I had completed earlier in the week, and over a longer distance. After 4 kilometres, and roughly two thirds of the way through the training plan for the run, I stopped and skipped to the cool down. I marked the run as way too hard and that I felt awful, prompting the training plan for next week to change so that if I was to attempt the same run again, the distance and pace were much more achievable.

Not completing a run made me think a lot about having safe spaces to fail in and the effect that it has on my motivation.

I spent some time over the weekend playing Horizon Forbidden West on the PlayStation. Progressed the main story a little as the recommended level for the story was way below the current level. That also expanded the map far enough to highlight some more side quests for me to complete.

My Nan was over for lunch on Sunday. We ended up playing a couple of games of Scrabble, and I lost by significant margins on both occasions.

## What has changed on this site:

- I added some photos of a [dragonfly that landed in the garden](/photos/20240713/).
- Some notes would have published dates in the published time zone, but the date shown would be in UTC. I've updated the filters so that all notes use `Europe/London` as the time zone.

## What I've been reading:

- Still reading [Death's End by Cixin Liu](/reading#now) this week.

## What I've been watching:

- [Episodes 4-7 in season 1 of The Acolyte](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/114479/season/1/).
