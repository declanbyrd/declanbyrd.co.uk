A short work week this week, only working three days.

I cancelled my Amazon Prime subscription this week. I'd watched a combined 9 films or tv shows in the last twelve months on Prime video, and purchased three things, yet the renewal price is Â£95 for the year. Didn't feel value for money.

On Tuesday, I played a basketball game for Worthing D&D White against South Coast Outlaws in the Basketball Sussex/Surrey plate competition. This was the second leg of the tie, and we came away with another win to progress to the next round of the competition. I thought I played my best basketball game of the season, making two three-pointers and getting a crucial defensive stop inside the last two minutes of the game.

I managed to get a free pint of beer this week. One of the local pubs was giving away free pints to celebrate the 30th anniversary of [Dark Star Brewery](https://www.darkstarbrewing.co.uk/pages/about-us). The beer they gave away was a recreation of one that won the best beer in Britain award back in 1987. I wasn't born then, let alone of legal drinking age so I can't make any comparisons to the award winning beer. I can only confirm that the free beer was nice.

I played a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn on the PlayStation this week. I've now cleared all the bandit camps, overridden all the Tallnecks, and managed to pass level 40 in the process. I think I managed to complete two of the main story missions during that time, and the recommended level for the current story mission is now at 25.
