Continuing to enforce the habit of running four times a week, by completing all four runs again this week. Two of these runs were for 35 minutes at an average pace of 7 minutes and 15 seconds per kilometre. One was a time trial over a distance of 2.6km that I completed in 13 minutes and 46 seconds. The last run was for 15 minutes with a goal pace of 6 minutes and 15 seconds per kilometre, but my average pace was nearly 10 seconds faster and I wasn't able to consistently keep to the goal pace.

I bought my ticket for [ffconf](https://2024.ffconf.org/) this week. The conference is not until November, but I left it too late to buy a ticket last year and it had sold out by the time I realised I could go.

Only one basketball session this week. I had a quiet session and didn't see a lot of the ball, but ran around a bit so I didn't feel like I had sat on the bench the whole time. The second session that I was planning to attend was cancelled due to a combination of wet weather and a leaky roof meant that the court was not safe to play on.

I subscribed to Discovery plus this week for their the Olympics coverage. A big factor in this was being able to choose which sports to watch live, which is something that the BBC no longer offer. As a result, I spent pretty much all weekend watching the basketball, and then switching to other live sports that were on between those games.

## What has changed on this site:

- No changes this week.

## What I've been reading:

- I finished reading [Death's End by Cixin Liu](/reading/9781784971625/). Managed to finish it with less than 24 hours before the library loan expired.
- I started reading [The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time by Mark Haddon](/reading#now) this week.

## What I've been watching:

- Mostly watching Olympic games coverage, so no tracked media this week.
