I was in London at the start of this week with Becka to celebrate her birthday. We went in lots of shops, and had a nice meal at [Sticks n Sushi in Covent Garden](https://sticksnsushi.com/en/restaurants/london/covent-garden). A good day all round.

Kobo released a version of their Clara e-reader with a coloured screen, and I bought one. So far I've only read some comics and some sample chapters on it, but its a nice reading experience. I placed a couple of holds on some books from the library so that when I finish the paper books that I'm currently reading I will have some books ready to read on my Kobo.

I was back in London for work a couple of days later. Thankfully I was able to travel later in the day and got a cheaper train ticket as a result. Managed to get a lot of reading done while I was on the train. There was a social event after work but I chose to leave not long after it started.

On Sunday, I was at the American Express stadium to watch [Brighton win 1-0 against Aston Villa](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3996834/joao-strikes-as-albion-return-to-winning-ways). There was a fair amount of pessimism before the game having not seen Brighton win at home since March, but there was a lot more optimism following this win.
