After not managing to run last week, I completed three runs this week using the 5k training plan from the Garmin coach function on my watch. While two of the runs were at a slow pace, I had one run this week that increased the pace guidelines by 30 seconds. I had no clue how much faster I was supposed to run when compared to the slower pace and constantly found I was going too fast. I'm quite pleased that I managed to find the motivation to go out and run multiple times.

I fell down the rabbit hole of Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL) over the weekend. I'm not really sure what prompted it, but I thought it would be a good idea to move my development environment from Windows into Ubuntu using WSL2. I haven't found anything that makes me annoyed that I hadn't done this earlier, yet there also hasn't been anything that has made me regret trying this in the first place. I suspect the issues will come with trying to work with files that are located in Ubuntu, but modified with Windows applications.

I spent a little bit of time playing Horizon Forbidden West on the PlayStation. I reached a point where the only quest with a marker on the map was the main story, so I reluctantly progressed the story enough to make more side missions available. Side missions feel more achievable when I only want to play for an hour, whereas the main story missions feel like they need longer sessions.
