I only managed one run this week. It was a fairly short one, running for 20 minutes and 5 minutes either side to warm-up and cool-down. I actually felt good running and found the pace comfortable. The following day I had a sharp pain in my left foot - like I'd stepped on Lego. I'm pretty sure I've inflamed a tendon which has been caused by a combination of my running style, choice of running shoes, and increasing my running distance too quickly. I've stopped running for now to prevent any further damage, but I'm disappointed as I was enjoying the training plan I was on.

I was at the American Express stadium on Wednesday to watch [Brighton lose 2-1 to Chelsea](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/4014537/welbeck-strikes-but-albion-are-beaten-by-chelsea). This was a frustrating game of football. I thought I was about to fall asleep at one point, and nearly 20 minutes of added time probably said more about the game than the score. 

I was back at the American Express stadium on Sunday to watch [Brighton lose 2-0 against Manchester United](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/4021898/de-zerbis-reign-ends-in-defeat-to-manchester-united) in the final game of the 23/24 Premier League season. A flat end to the season, overshadowed by Roberto De Zerbi and his back-room staff leaving the club. They brought a style of attacking football to Brighton that I likely will never see again, and games in Europe that I feel lucky to have witnessed. I guess until August, my mood will no longer be dictated by the outcome of 22 players kicking a ball about for 90 minutes.

I've been reading a lot in my free time this week. Its likely the novelty of owning a new gadget, but I've found reading on my Kobo e-reader a lot more enjoyable than reading a paper book.

I spent a little bit of time assessing how to remove (or replace) hashtags in the Mastodon posts that I display on my site. The Mastodon API endpoint returns the tags and the post content, but no way of indicating if the tags are intended to be part of the post content or if the tags are for discovery purposes only. I already have a GitHub issue open for [eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive](https://github.com/declanbyrd/eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive) to separate tags from content with the end goal of merging the Mastodon tags with 11ty's tag collection.

## What has changed on this site:

- I deleted my now page. I neglected it, and most of the automations for that page are in-use elsewhere on this site. Most of the status updates I was making to the now page can be replaced with short notes that I can publish on my site and syndicate elsewhere (POSSE).
- There is now pagination on the journal page, notes page, and the articles page inside the journal. I no longer only have a few posts, and the journal page in particular has grown too big. Those pages are now capped to 25 posts per page.
