Very similar running schedule to last week including two shorter runs and one longer run. The only change was that instead of a goal pace run, I had sprint intervals. I don't like the sprint intervals because I find it really difficult to adjust when running at a fast pace, and as a result run faster than the pace guidelines. I much prefer the slower runs where once I find the pace, I can clear my mind and not have to focus on anything other than getting one foot in front of the other fast enough to not fall over.

Two basketball sessions this week. The temperature in the sports hall was much higher this week, and it was noticeable while playing. I found it tougher to keep running as the session went on, though the sessions also happened to be on days where I had run either 5km or 7km in the morning. Unsurprisingly, I didn't shoot the ball well but I was pleased that I didn't allow myself to get frustrated by it.

Had a good day out in Portsmouth on Sunday. Managed to buy some things that I needed.

I got excited this week when I saw that [World of Goo 2](https://worldofgoo2.com/) had been released. I never completed the first game, but I have good memories of playing it on the Nintendo Wii when I was younger. The first game is still installed on my phone from before Netflix released a "remastered" version, so this might be the nudge I need to try and finish it. I also used to have a CD with the soundtrack for the first game, with "ode to the bridge builder" being among my most played tracks. I'm yet to decide if I want to play the sequel on the Nintendo Switch or on my laptop.
