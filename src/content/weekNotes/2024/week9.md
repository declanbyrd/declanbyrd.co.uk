Not much of note this week, so the notes are a bit brief.

On Thursday I had a basketball game for Worthing D&D White against South Coast Outlaws in the Basketball Sussex plate competition. This was the first of a two legs, and we managed to come away with a win.

I've been playing a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn on the PlayStation. Making lots of progress in the side quests, and now progressed to a level which is 10 higher than the recommended level for the story mission that I've been neglecting.
