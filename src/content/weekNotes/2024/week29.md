On Monday, Becka and I went to see Cat Burns perform an acoustic set at Chalk in Brighton. While this wouldn't have been my choice, I enjoyed this gig. I don't know if it was because it was an acoustic set but this was probably the first gig I've been to where everything felt calm. We also went in Casa don Carlos beforehand for some food which was a very good decision.

I had a basketball session on Tuesday. It wasn't my best session and I wasn't shooting the ball well until the last game of the session. I had a run of good sessions prior to this one, so I wasn't too surprised when I had a bad one.

I took Thursday and Friday off work this week. A long weekend was very much needed.

On Thursday, Becka and I travelled up to London to see [Great Britain play South Sudan in a basketball game at the Copper Box Arena](https://gb.basketball/late-heroics-but-gb-fall-short-to-south-sudan/). A really good game of basketball considering that it was an exhibition game and the outcome had little significance. I managed to accumulate a key ring and a Subway bucket hat by making a free-throw in the fan park before the game. I'm not sure its sensible to wear the bucket hat outside as it is covered in images of sandwiches - seagulls may not be able to tell the difference.

I managed to complete another four runs this week. There were some minor changes to my plan this week with my easy runs now being longer by an additional 5 minutes with an increased time for warm-up and cool-down. I was still able to comfortably complete them, though I had to think more about the route I was taking to account for the additional time. I had a challenging run at a faster pace later in the week. I managed to complete it but I napped most of the afternoon as a result. I also got attacked by a seagull on one of my runs - I'm hoping this doesn't become a regular occurrence.

On Sunday, Becka and I attempted to complete a [river walk in Arundel](https://www.visitarundel.co.uk/listing/arundel-river-walk-2/). We took a wrong turn somewhere and ended up in a dead-end. My phone had no signal and the website that contained the map did not work offline so we tried to head back rather than search for a way to get back on the correct path. By the time we had re-traced our steps, we had walked over 8km and decided to walk back to the car instead of completing the rest of the route. It was still a nice walk though and has good views when at the top of the hill. Also, websites that contain walking instructions and/or maps should be progressive web apps or at the very least work without JavaScript.

The [sleepy fox that was sunbathing on a neighbours roof](/photos/20230809/) in August last year was back and a little more awake this week.
