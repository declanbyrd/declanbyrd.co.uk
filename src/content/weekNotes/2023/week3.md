I had a basketball game for Worthing D&D White this week. We played [away at Bognor GSD and won 66-75](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/33593482.html). I finished with 6 points, scoring twice from behind the three-point line.

Google Stadia finally went offline. I spent over 463 hours playing on Stadia so I was grateful that it gave me the opportunity to play games that I might not have otherwise played. Being able to play without needing a subscription, on a device that I already had, wherever I felt like playing (internet connection permitting) was great. While I could have spent Stadia's final week playing games there, I chose to spend the time on the PlayStation instead. Aside from the longer sessions spent playing the Guardians of the Galaxy, I played a couple of games in seasons mode on FIFA 23.

On Saturday, I watched [Brighton draw 2-2 away at Leicester](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3031868/its-fergie-time-as-evans-late-leveller-lifts-albion). The positivity in the away end was infectious and really contributed to the atmosphere. [Roberto De Zerbi thinks the team is currently playing at 60% of its potential](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3029470/lallana-de-zerbi-believes-were-only-at-60/) and we're playing great football, it's going to be great fun as the team gets closer to fulfilling that potential.

## What has changed on this site:

- Some of the books I read would have 0 pages. This seems to be an issue with the API that I get the book data from. I've added the correct page numbers for any of the books that were previously showing 0 pages. I've been trying to add more to the reading page, but I definitely read books with more pages than that.

## What I've been reading:

- I finished reading [Guardians Of The Galaxy Team-up! (Marvel Select)](/reading/#currentlyReading).
- I read [Curse of the Man-Thing (Marvel Select)](/reading/9781804910269/)
