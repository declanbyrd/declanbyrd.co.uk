I had two basketball sessions again this week. I found both sessions quite challenging and didn't play well in either. I was ready to go home after an hour in both sessions but convinced myself to stay for the full hour and a half.

I was playing Star Wars Battlefront 2 on the PS5 this week. I wanted to continue the story mode but accidentally entered the quick match mode and joined an online game. I wasn't particularly good but I found that game mode rather addictive. I didn't get around to continuing the story mode, but I played many more online games.

I was mentally exhausted by the end of this week. I think a large factor in that has been the amount of pressure I put on myself. As a result, I haven't really felt relaxed and finding the motivation to do small tasks has been difficult.
