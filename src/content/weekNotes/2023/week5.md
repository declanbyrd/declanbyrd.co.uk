I played in [Worthing D&D White's 84-62 win against Bognor GSD](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/33593487.html) this week, but finished with 0 points. It was one of those games where it felt like every pass to me was either at my ankles or over my head, so I frequently found myself having to pass the ball out of a position that I normally would have shot the ball from.

I was at The Amex to watch [Brighton win 1-0 against Bournemouth](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3048710/more-mitoma-magic-as-albion-leave-it-late). Not the most entertaining game, but on another day it could have been a game that we had lost or drawn. So good to see us find a way to win against a team that sat deep, hoped to score goals on the counter attack and continuously wasted time in dead ball situations.

With Twitter announcing that their [API will no longer be free to use from the 9<sup>th</sup> of February](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922), I deleted the workflow in [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/) that I used to automate the syndication of my week notes to Twitter. That also means this week's notes and any future notes won't be syndicated there. Pipedream worked very well when I was using it so I'm now looking at other things I can use it for.

## What has changed on this site:

- The code that I previously used to archive my tweets to this site has been deleted. It used the Twitter API but I also don't tweet anymore so thought it would be better to delete it.
- I added my notes for [Internet for the People by Ben Tarnoff](/reading/9781839762024/).

## What I've been reading:

- I finished reading [Internet for the People by Ben Tarnoff](/reading/9781839762024/).
