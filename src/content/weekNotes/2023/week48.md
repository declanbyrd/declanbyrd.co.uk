On Tuesday, I played in [Worthing D&D White's defeat to East Grinstead Flyers](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/35866555.html). I can't remember the score, but I'm pretty sure we lost by around 20. The Basketball Sussex website isn't updating the fixtures with the scores anymore either so I might have to update this post later if I find out what the score was. I didn't have the best game and struggled to get going off the bench in what was a very cold sports hall.

I picked up The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom again this week. I'd pretty much forgotten the controls in the time that I'd stopped playing and continued to accidentally throw my melee weapons instead of firing arrows using the bow.

I had good intentions of keeping up with [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) this week, but I've already made the decision to stop. My initial idea was to solve the problems in a language that I hadn't written any code in before (Go) and blog about what I had learned each day to solve the two-part problems. I realised quite quickly that this was over-ambitious and hadn't accounted for the time it would take to get familiar with the standard libraries. It took me a day and a half to get a solution for the first part of the first day's problem and I knew that I would need more time than a free evening to provide a working solution for each day. So I've stopped. For now anyway. I still think there is value in writing up my learnings with a new language by completing an advent of code, but I'm not going to limit myself to the month of December.

By publishing these notes, I will have now written notes about my week for 100 consecutive weeks.
