I had two basketball sessions this week. I was tired before the first session started and so I found it hard to mentally and physically keep up with the pace of the games. I thought I played much better in the second session but I felt very tired by the end.

On Saturday I travelled to Villa Park to watch [Brighton lose 6-1 against Aston Villa](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3705954/fati-strikes-but-its-a-day-to-forget-for-albion). It was Brighton's heaviest defeat since 2012 when they lost 6-0 away against West Ham. Unfortunately I was also at that game.

I've been playing the new EA Sports FC 24 game on the PS5 this week. Most of that time was in the online seasons mode where I can play as Brighton against other players.
