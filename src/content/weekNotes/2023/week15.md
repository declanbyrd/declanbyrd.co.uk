On Tuesday, I played in [Worthing D&D White's 89-55 win against Worthing D&D Ballers](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/33593472.html). I shot the ball quite well this week, finishing the game with six points having made two three-point shots.

I managed to spend some time on the PlayStation this week. Most of that time was spent playing career mode in FIFA 23 because it didn't require a lot of attention and could be played in shorter sessions.

On Saturday, I was in Worthing for the [tap takeover](https://worthingtaptakeover.co.uk/). In total, we visited seven pubs and sampled beers from different independent brewers. Bruno was particularly pleased that he was able to join in by sampling dog biscuits and various water bowls.

I looked into how design tokens could be implemented in an 11ty project. It didn't take me long to create a JSON file of variables, use Nunjucks to convert them to CSS variables and then refactor the CSS files to use the design token values. I'll probably create a blog post on how I've used them on my site. [Utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) was a great resource for generating fluid spacing and typography variables.

I got to watch some of the NBA playoffs this week. The first round of the play-offs have included a couple of games that tipped-off earlier so I wasn't having to stay up to the early hours of the morning to watch them. Now I just have to filter out all the results so I can watch the rest of the play-off games without seeing the scores.

## What has changed on this site:

- This site now uses design tokens for spacing, typography sizes and colours.
- The colophon page was updated with resources from [Utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/).

## What I've been reading:

- I read a chapter of [Coders by Clive Thompson](/reading/#currentlyReading).
