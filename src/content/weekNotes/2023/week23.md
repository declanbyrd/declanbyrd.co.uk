description: Back to work, a complete Mastodon archive, and a tower fan.
---

I was back at work this week after having last week off. I had a bit of difficulty catching up with things I missed while I was away.

I bought a tower fan, just in time for the UK to have its hottest day of the year so far. The built-in sleep timer has been particularly useful.

I released version 0.2.0 of [eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive). This version resolved one of the biggest onboarding issues with the plugin which was that you would be missing posts if you used the plugin and had more than 40 public posts. I installed the latest plugin version for this site so that I could verify that I have an up-to-date archive of my Mastodon posts on each build. Pretty cool to have all my Mastodon posts available on this site as [notes](/journal/notes). 

The time I spent on the PlayStation this week was mostly in a FIFA23 career mode. Despite its repetitiveness, I find it very easy to spend hours playing and don't need to spend time familiarising myself with the controls each time I play. With the growing number of games now I've started and not finished yet, I need to set aside some time to complete some of them before more games that I want to play are released.

## What has changed on this site:

- If there is a long URL, it will now wrap to a new line instead of causing the page to scroll horizontally.
- I'm now using version 0.2.0 of eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive.
- There was a duplicate header on the [reading page](/reading/) that has now been removed.
- There was an empty div that would render in social posts because a conditional statement was missing a length check.

## What I've been reading:

- A couple of issues from the [Avengers: The Kang Dynasty Omnibus by Kurt Busiek](/reading/#currentlyReading).

## What I've been watching:

- [Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76600).
