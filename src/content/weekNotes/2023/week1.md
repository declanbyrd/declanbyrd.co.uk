I was back to work this week after a break over the Christmas period. Despite it being a shortened work week I definitely found it hard to adjust, feeling increasingly more tired as the week progressed.

Most of my time this week was spent trying to finish my [year in review](/journal/2022/review) post for 2022. I think I spent more time making small changes than actually writing it. Hopefully by next year I'll be able to use it as a template and it will make writing it easier.

When I was little, my dad used to buy my brother and I comics when we had tidied our bedrooms. Well I tidied my room, so I bought myself some comics. I picked up some Marvel Select bookazines which will add some variety to my reading list.

I started playing Guardians of the Galaxy on the PlayStation. Some of the early gameplay is similar to the Tomb Raider games which I enjoyed, so I've got high expectations.

## What has changed on this site:

- I added a Netlify redirect for `/.well-known/webfinger` so that it points to the webfinger for my account on indieweb.social. This means that searching for `@declan@declanbyrd.co.uk` in the Fediverse will show my Mastodon account.
- I refactored the template for rendering the links to my social media profiles.
- I added IDs to the years on the [reading page](/reading/) so that I could link to the books that I'd read in a particular year.
- I published my [year in review post for 2022](/journal/2022/review/).

## What I've been reading:

- I read a couple of chapters from Don't Make Me Think: Revisited by Steve Krug.
