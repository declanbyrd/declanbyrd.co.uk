description: Time off, bullet journals, and skipping games in a series.

For the second consecutive week, I only worked for three days. I had some holiday that needed to be taken before the end of March otherwise it would have expired. 

Most of this free time was spent on the PlayStation. I found that how I game is quite similar to how I work, in that if I know I have distractions coming up, I will try to avoid committing to completing something. Knowing I wasn't going to have many distractions when I was playing Assassin's Creed: Odyssey meant I was completing more of the story objectives that I knew would be time consuming. I also had a major brain-fart when playing, that I somehow skipped Assassin's Creed: Origins despite also having it in my game library. Guess I'll have to go back to it once I've completed Odyssey.

On Thursday, I travelled up to Horsham to play in Worthing D&D White's [91-95 loss against Horsham Hawks](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/33593468.html). We were missing two of our starting line-up and so we only travelled with six players. We did very well to keep the score as close as we did. I had a very poor game shooting the ball, only making one three-point shot from approximately ten attempts. The one I did make was just as the shot clock was about to expire so I was quite pleased it went in. 

I spent some time this week thinking about the [journal](/journal/) page on this site. At the moment, it only really shows my Mastodon posts and any longer writings. It doesn't really reflect the same things that I used to keep in a bullet journal and I wanted to make the journal page more than just what I've written or posted on social media. I started to track the books that I've finished reading in the journal page now and started to think about how I could track other activities in there too while keeping it all on a static website.

## What has changed on this site:

- Books that I've read are now included in the [journal](/journal/) with status updates.
- I added a book icon for the book updates in the [journal](/journal/).

## What I've been reading:

- I read [Marvel Select Secret Invasion: Meet The Skrulls](/reading/9781804911143/).
- I read a chapter of [Coders by Clive Thompson](/reading/#currentlyReading).

## What I've been watching:

- [Right Here, Right Now (2023)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1083055-fatboy-slim-right-here-right-now).
- [Episode 4 in Season 3](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/82856-the-mandalorian/season/3/episode/4) of [The Mandalorian](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/82856-the-mandalorian).
