I managed to watch Brighton play twice this week. On Wednesday, I was at Brighton's training ground in Lancing to watch the [men's under 21 team play against Valencia in the Premier League International Cup](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3100665/albion-knocked-out-by-injury-time-goal). A very entertaining game of football saw Valencia win 3-2, scoring the winning goal in the last minute of added time at the end of the second half. Brighton played very well and it was interesting to see how they've tried to adapt to play a similar style of play to the first team. 

On Saturday I travelled up to Leeds to watch [Brighton and Leeds draw 2-2](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3103193/mac-allister-and-march-on-target-but-albion-are-held) at Elland Road. It felt like two points dropped but Brighton never really did enough to win the game. Too often it felt like Leeds were running faster and wanting to win more than the Brighton players.

I've been enjoying reading comics recently and discovered this week that my local library has a large collection of comics available on Libby. I borrowed a couple of Marvel ones that I had heard of and read them on my phone and Surface tablet. It's not the same feeling as reading the paper based equivalents but it has saved me around Â£30 compared to buying physical copies. The only issue I've found so far is that not all e-books have ISBN numbers, so tracking the books that I'm reading has so far involved finding the ISBN for the physical copies and using those instead.

I played some Assassin's Creed: Odyssey this week. I've not really advanced the main story at all because I keep finding other things to do instead. I think I have completed more caves than I have quests.
