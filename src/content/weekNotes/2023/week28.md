description: 'Back playing basketball, and short domain names.'
---

School sports halls are no longer being used for exams, so I was back playing basketball this week. I managed to attend two sessions and had a good time at both. I hadn't touched a basketball since the season ended in May so I was very rusty. I tired quite quickly in both sessions and it was significantly more noticeable in the second session where I scored twice in quick succession before missing all my other attempts. I recovered quite well between sessions, so hoping to repeat the same sessions next week.

I bought a new domain name. I'd been looking for a short domain that I could experiment with and that resulted in the purchase of [dec.lol](http://dec.lol). Initially I was hoping that some of the common misspellings of my name might be available as domain names but they were either taken or they didn't have a top level domain that matched. At the moment dec.lol redirects everything to [declanbyrd.co.uk](https://declanbyrd.co.uk), but I don't intend to use the short domain as the primary domain for my personal website.

I finished the story in Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on the PS5. The game felt shorter than the first Spider-Man game, and if my play time stats are anything to go by, it's because I spent an additional 10 hours in the first game. Most of the remaining PlayStation trophies either required starting (and completing) the "new game plus" mode, or replaying some of the levels. I'm looking forward to playing Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 when it launches later this year.

I wrote some Node.js scripts to populate the frontmatter for the book note markdown files. This meant I no longer needed to request data for 30 books at build time and could make modifications to the data before deploying the pages. I also wrote about [making the Node.js scripts](/journal/2023/generating-frontmatter-from-api/).

## What has changed on this site:

- There are no longer duplicate tags in the journal.
- Notes for all the books I've read now have the book data stored in the frontmatter of the Markdown file.

## What I've been reading:

- I read the first six chapters from [A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman](/reading/#now).

## What I've been watching:

- [Episode 4 in season 1 of Secret Invasion](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/114472/season/1/episode/4).
