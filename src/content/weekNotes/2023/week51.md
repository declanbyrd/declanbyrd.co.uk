On Tuesday, I had a basketball game for [Worthing D&D White against Worthing D&D Black](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/35866682.html). Unfortunately, the game was cancelled part-way through. The court became too slippery due to the condensation in the sports hall and in the interest of health of safety, the referees decided it was best for the game to stop before anyone got seriously injured.

My car broke down on my way back from the basketball game, which was rather annoying.

I spent most of the week visiting Becka's family. It was nice to be able to spend some time with them in the build up to Christmas.

I've been playing Assassin's Creed Origins on the PS5 this week. After accidentally missing it out and jumping straight into Assassin's Creed Odyssey earlier in the year, I decided to stop playing Odyssey and complete the story in Origins first. I've enjoyed the game so far, though I've not progressed the story very far because I've been completing all of the side quests instead.

Becka and I continued to play It Takes Two on the PlayStation. Because we didn't finish the level when we stopped playing last week, when we attempted to continue where we left it we had to restart the level. We did eventually defeat the evil vacuum cleaner and have made sure that the game saved, so that we can continue the next level later.
