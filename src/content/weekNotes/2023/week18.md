I discovered Frumpets (French toast battered crumpets) this week. Becka and I went to [Oeuf Caf√© in Hove](https://oeuf.cafe/) where they serve them with a range of toppings. I had mine topped with bacon, melted cheddar cheese, caramelised onion and chilli jam. I still think about that meal sometimes.

On Tuesday, I played in [Worthing D&D White's 91-63 win against Haywards Heath Panthers](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/34612866.html) in the quarter finals of the Basketball Sussex play-offs. I really struggled to shoot the ball well and found it difficult to get a shooting rhythm, failing to score from 6 three-point attempts. We now play [Eastbourne Lions away in the semi-finals](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/34632939.html).

On Thursday, I was at the Amex to watch [Brighton win 1-0 against Manchester United](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3300383/mac-allister-is-spot-on-as-albion-climb-to-sixth). It was starting to look like one of those games where Brighton just couldn't quite find a way through. To win the game by scoring a penalty against a team that had knocked us out of the FA cup on penalties a few weeks ago, felt almost scripted. It feels a bit strange and I don't really want to jinx it, but it's looking more and more likely that Brighton will be playing in a European competition next season.

I spent all of Saturday playing [Star Wars Jedi: Survivor](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/). I made quite a bit of progress once I realised that most of the collectibles in the game are purely cosmetic and I only needed to focus on the stim canister dispensers and force essences. I got a bit stuck when I discovered a force tear and after several attempts I gave up and carried on with the story objective. When I played Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order on Google Stadia, I would get frustrated that I could only save at meditation points since Stadia would end the game session after a period of inactivity. It's nice playing on the PS5, that the game state is preserved when the console enters rest mode. Meaning that I don't need to reach an auto-save point in the game in order to stop playing.

On Sunday, I went to the Dome Cinema to watch Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3. I was quite glad that I didn't have to explain the Infinity Saga to my parents and they were able to understand the premise of the film without needing a full recap on the events within the MCU.
