The week started with Christmas day, which was very busy but it was nice to spend time with all the family.

Most of this week was spent wondering what day of the week it actually was. Some days felt like they were skipped over, and some completely forgotten about.

On Thursday, I was at the American Express stadium to watch [Brighton win 4-2 against Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3840722/joao-spot-on-again-as-albion-end-year-with-thrilling-win). A great win to finish the calendar year.

The week finished with a family meal at Very Italian Pizza in Saltdean. It was a very nice meal, and the calzone I had was particularly good.

## What has changed on this site:

- There were some links that were not underlined. All links on the site now are now underlined.
- I've got a new Open Graph graphic, so when my site is shared on social media, my face is no longer the big picture in the card.
- A couple of dependency updates.
