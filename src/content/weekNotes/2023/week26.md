description: Less procrastinating, and decreasing the difficulty for boss fights.
---

I was on the PlayStation for most evening during the week. I completed the story mode for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which was really fun. Not ashamed to say that I adjusted the difficulty for a couple of the "boss fights" at the end of the game. I could have carried on in the difficulty that I used for the rest of the game but I also wanted to progress the story once I realised I was nearing the end of the game so decreased the difficulty by one level. In total, it took me approximately 28 hours to complete the story.

Instead of making progress in any of the other games that I started playing, I then found some time over the weekend to start and complete the story mode in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. According to the PlayStation, I completed the game in approximately 2 hours. I might keep this one installed since the multiplayer mode looks like it could be fun.

I noticed this week that I'm starting to procrastinate less. I no longer have access to as many doom-scrolling sites, thanks to rate limiting and the extinction of third-party apps. I've found that as I'm not picking up my phone as much when I get bored, that I'm picking up other things instead. For the first time (that I can remember) I started and finished a 400+ page book in the same day. I doubt I'll be making a habit out of it, but it made a change to spending the same amount of time in front of a screen.

## What has changed on this site:

- Instead of making API requests and handling the cache for each of the data sources that this site uses, I'm now using [Eleventy fetch](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/fetch/) to handle the caching of API requests.
- The [colophon page](/colophon) has been updated to show the data sources that this site uses.
