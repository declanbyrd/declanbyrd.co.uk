description: Micropub, and a first away game of the Premier League season.

I was back playing basketball this week, participating in two sessions. I expected to struggle, particularly in the first session but I played better than I thought I would. By the second session I had a better idea of when I needed to sit out and managed to find a pace that was manageable.

On Saturday, I travelled to Molineux stadium to watch [Brighton win 4-1 against Wolves](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3640283/albion-march-to-top-of-the-table). Very good performance from Brighton, some great goals, and the result meant that Brighton finished the weekend at the top of the Premier League table! I wasn't so appreciative of the flame throwers that were used pre-match and when the players walked out for the second half. It was already rather warm being stood in the sunshine and then it got uncomfortably warm every time the flame throwers were used.

I've been exploring the idea of creating a Micropub server. I'd like to be able to share things to my website without having to use git on the device I'm authoring from. I managed to get a proof of concept working that would publish a note to my site when I submitted a HTML form. Eventually I'd like to be able to publish my week notes or other articles, small notes, photos, and finished books, all from a Micropub client.

I didn't really spend much time on the PlayStation this week. I think I managed maybe an hour of Star Wars Battlefront 2. The co-op missions I played in seemed to have started quite a bit before I joined the game so I got to play for around 5 minutes before the mission ended.

## What has changed on this site:

- I moved my week notes back into the [journal](/journal).

## What I've been reading:

- I didn't read any of [A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman](https://declanbyrd.co.uk/reading/#now) this week.

## What I've been watching:

- [Episode 3 in season 3 of Only Murders in the Building](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/107113/season/3/episode/3).
