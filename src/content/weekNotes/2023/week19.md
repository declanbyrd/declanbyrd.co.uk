description: Running, Tears of the Kingdom, and an end to the basketball season.

I started this week with a run. I'd never really done a run before. I tried to do couch to 5k a while ago, but I never really got into it. Instead, I adopted a pace I felt comfortable with and ran 5k without stopping. It took me just under 40 minutes so it wasn't exactly fast, but it has given me some confidence in my running ability. My legs were very sore for the rest of the week.

On Monday, I was also at The Amex to watch [Brighton lose 5-1 against Everton](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3327398/a-night-to-forget-for-albion). The less said about that the better.

I stumbled across the [psn-api](https://psn-api.achievements.app/) this week. I'm now using it to show my recently played PlayStation games on my homepage. The games that are currently listed probably won't change for a while, since I'm still enjoying Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. It will still update with the last time that I played each game though.

I also started playing [The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-1576884.html). The small amount that I played was enjoyable. Familiar controls and mechanics with a new story and enemies.

On Friday, I played in [Worthing D&D White's 110-86 loss against Eastbourne Lions](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/34632939.html). I say played, but it was only 1 and a half minutes at the end of the fourth quarter, so I didn't really have an impact on the game. That brought an end to my season so I've got no basketball now until July when school sports halls are no longer being used for exams.

On Sunday, I went to the Emirates Stadium to watch [Brighton win 3-0 against Arsenal](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3345249/three-and-easy-as-magnificent-albion-move-up-to-sixth). A brilliant day out and a much better performance than earlier in the week.
