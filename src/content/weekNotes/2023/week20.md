description: Bone conducting headphones and tonsilitis.

I've been playing a lot of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom this week. Being able to play in handheld mode was a large factor in the reason for that. In that time, I completed my first temple and a couple of shrines.

On Wednesday, I went for another run after feeling positive about the one I went for last week. In total I ran 6km and while it wasn't particularly quick, my time per kilometre was around a minute faster than last week. I had bought some bone conductor headphones which were particularly good for running as they allowed me to hear my surroundings while also listening to music.

I got tonsilitis. Not nice.

On Sunday, I was at The Amex to watch [Brighton win 3-1 against Southampton](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3448240/europe-here-we-come) and qualify for European football next season. I'm still in shock at how this season has played out and how despite everything that has happened. The team have delivered something that would have been unthinkable not that long ago.
