I'm feeling much better at the time of writing these notes than compared to [last week](/journal/2023/week31/). I was still feeling a bit lethargic earlier in the week, but that quickly went away.

I got to go to the cinema this week so see [Barbie (2023)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/346698). It was definitely not a kids film. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, though I was initially concerned that I'd seen the first 15 minutes of the film in the trailers.

On the PlayStation this week I continued to play the co-op missions in Star Wars Battlefront 2. I'm starting to finish in the top three players at the end of missions. I also started to play The LEGO® Movie Videogame. The LEGO games have a repetition that I find quite relaxing and 100% completing the games is often a trivial task once each level has been completed in free play mode. The number of cutscenes in this particular game is rather annoying but I guess unlike other LEGO games, they already had an entire film that they could use for cutscenes.

On Saturday, I was at the American Express Stadium to watch [Brighton start the new season by winning 4-1 against Luton Town](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3630184/subs-seal-impressive-win-for-albion). Brighton probably should have scored more given some of the chances that they created, but it's pretty difficult to complain when you win by three goals.

I finished the week bottom of my family's fantasy football league. My decision to captain João Pedro instead of Erling Haaland played a part in that.

## What has changed on this site:
