title: 2023 Week Notes - Week 21

description: Airtable barcode scanning, and Europa League football.
---

A shorter set of notes this week, only covering Monday to Friday.

I was experimenting with [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) this week. The Airtable mobile app includes the option to scan a barcode and insert the value of the barcode into a table. I thought that would help with logging the books that I read, since the barcode contains the ISBN-13 value which I then use to query `node-isbn`. I could then pull the data from Airtable back into this site and use it in place of the markdown files that I'm currently using to record the books I've read. At the moment, I'm not sure if the benefits of using Airtable would make it worthwhile moving my data there.

On Wednesday, I was at The Amex to watch [Brighton draw 1-1 against Manchester City](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3486691/julio-hits-another-stunner-as-albion-seal-europa-league) and mathematically secure a place in the Europa League next season. That was probably the last time I'll see some of the players wear Brighton's shirts before they inevitably move on to bigger and possibly better things. It would be sad to see them leave, but I'm grateful to all the players for making so many weekends (and a couple of weeknights too) very happy ones. Hopefully the good times continue next season.

## What has changed on this site:

- The recent gaming section on the homepage was removed. The API it was pulling data from required manual authentication which didn't work with my current deployment infrastructure.
- The preview images that I use for my photos are now slightly larger.

## What I've been reading:

- I started reading [Avengers: The Kang Dynasty Omnibus by Kurt Busiek](/reading/#currentlyReading).

## What I've been watching:

- [Episode 6 in Season 1 of Citadel](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/114922-citadel/season/1/episode/6).
