I had a short work week this week, only working from Monday through to Wednesday.

On Wednesday I was at the American Express stadium to watch [Brighton win 2-1 against Brentford](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3810653/hinshelwood-heads-the-winner-as-albion-come-from-behind). A dominant win in the end, and it was great to see yet another teenager score for Brighton. I was back at the American Express stadium on Saturday too to watch [Brighton draw 1-1 with Burnley](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3815312/adingra-on-target-but-keeper-trafford-defies-albion). A little more disappointing this time.

On Thursday, Becka and I went to Gunwharf Quays in Portsmouth to do some Christmas shopping. We managed to pick up pretty much everything we needed, and I was also able to get some things for myself.

On Friday, Becka and I walked into Shoreham for the Christmas market. It was very busy but worth looking around. I was able to pick up some Christmas presents from the shops that had extended their opening hours for the evening.

Sunday was spent making sausage rolls. As is tradition in our house, these get made each year so that there is ready-made food for the days after Christmas. This year's sausage meat flavours were pork, pork and leek, and Toulouse.
