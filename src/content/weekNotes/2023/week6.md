description: Upgrading to Eleventy 2.0, frozen kneecaps, and going to the cinema to avoid the football scores.

I managed to spend some time on the PlayStation this week, completing a few levels in the Guardians of the Galaxy game. I find it difficult to start and stop playing this game as I prefer to complete whole levels rather than leaving them part way through. I also picked up Star wars Battlefront 2 and FIFA 23 for a couple of quick games later in the week when I didn't think I had enough time to complete a level in Guardians of the Galaxy.

In a slight change to my seemingly weekly routine of watching Brighton play football, I visited the American Express Elite Football Performance Centre (Brighton's training ground) to watch [Brighton's under-21 team play Sparta Prague in the Premier League International Cup](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3055010/under-21s-through-in-international-cup-despite-defeat). It was entertaining game despite Brighton losing 1-0. It was probably the coldest I've been at a football game in a long time (double socks and thermals did little to keep me warm) and I'm pretty sure my kneecaps were frozen by full-time.

I played in [Worthing D&D White's 103-82 win against Horsham Hawks 2](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/33593489.html) this week. Another game where I struggled to find a rhythm shooting the ball, but I managed to make a couple of three-pointers in the second half to finish the game with 6 points. I've not got any games or training sessions for a few weeks now.

Brighton played Crystal Palace in the Premier League this week. I didn't go and it's the one team that as a Brighton fan, you don't want to lose to. To prevent myself from spending all afternoon biting my fingernails, Becka agreed to trip to a place where it's socially unacceptable to use your phone - the cinema. [Roald Dahl's Matilda the Musical (2022)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/668482-matilda) wouldn't have been my preferred choice (Becka's pick) though it did stop me from looking at my phone for a lengthy period of time which also happened to coincide with the duration of the football game. I was very relieved to find out that the score finished 1-1 when I left the cinema.

## What has changed on this site:

- This site is now using Eleventy 2.0.

- The data for each book is now being cached using `flat-cache`, which has improved the build times by ~12 seconds.
