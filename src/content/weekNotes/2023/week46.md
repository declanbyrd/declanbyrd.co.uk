description: Notes for the 46th week of 2023.

I had another shorter working week, working only four days. There's a lot of context that I've missed while I was away from work and its been quite difficult to catch-up.

This site ranked 6th overall in the [Eleventy leaderboards](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/) that were updated this week. I always feel conflicted when my site ranks highly, because while I think its cool that a computer thinks my site is fast, I have very little insight into the experience when people visit my site. Up until last year I was guessing what the experience was like when viewing my site in Safari because I didn't own an Apple device.

I spent most of the weekend on the PlayStation. I managed to complete the story mode for Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, and for once I didn't resume the game with only one level remaining in the story. I really enjoyed this game and I think a part of that was because the gameplay had a lot of similarities with the Star Wars Jedi games that I've also enjoyed playing. I've now downloaded the previous Ratchet & Clank game that was initially released for the PlayStation 4 and hoping it is as good as Rift Apart.
