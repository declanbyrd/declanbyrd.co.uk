This week, I got to fly out to Tallinn to meet my work colleagues in-person for the first time. Before this week, I'd only interacted with them virtually and I found the in-person interactions I had this week to be very valuable. One of the reasons for this, was that we placed as much emphasis on getting to know everyone outside of work, as we did getting to know how each of us works when we are working. The near constant socialising did mean that my social battery was very much empty by the end of the week.

On Saturday, I was at the Amex to watch [Brighton win 6-0 against Wolves](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3245199/back-on-track-with-six-of-the-best). Great to be able to celebrate six goals. I was particularly impressed with Billy Gilmour and Deniz Undav who played very well considering they had struggled in the games that they'd previously played in. 

I started playing Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on the PS5 this week. I didn't play for long as the game only saves when you reach a meditation point. I also forgot that when you meditate at any of the checkpoints, all the enemies respawn. I'm looking forward to playing more of the game.
