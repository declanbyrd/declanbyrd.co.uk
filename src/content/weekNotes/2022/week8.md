For the week starting 21st February, I:

- Played in [Worthing D&D's 96-46 win over Shoreham Spartans](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/31514887.html). Still top of the league having won 6/6.

- Added the [reading page](https://declanbyrd.co.uk/reading/) to this site. I'll be using it to track the books that I've been reading and what I thought about them as I read them. I haven't added the notes for the books that I've read so far or published the journal entry about how I built it but sometimes its better to release something and update than not release at all.

- Took my camera out on Friday while walking Bruno and got a few photos of the sunset from Shoreham beach.

- Watched [Brighton lose 2-0 at home to Aston Villa](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2506828/match-report-albion-beaten-by-villa).

- Took my camera out again on Sunday to capture another sunset.

People are walking between gaps in the rocks on the beach with sea spray creating a mist so the people look like silhouettes. A wind surfer is packing away their equipment in the distance to the right of the photo and their colorful kite can be seen next to the setting sun. The town of Worthing and Worthing pier are in the background." %}
