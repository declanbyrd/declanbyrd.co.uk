description: A week off work and Dave Made a Maze
---

For the week starting 30th May:

- I watched [The Script at The Brighton Centre](https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39993386-script-at-brighton-centre). I can't say I'd listened to The Script much before this gig and couldn't name many of their songs. 
- I had the week off work. I spent most of the week away from my laptop, trying to avoid spending all day in front of a screen.
- I watched [Dave Made a Maze](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/433941-dave-made-a-maze). I'm still confused by the ending of this film.
- I read a good chunk of [The Man Who Died Twice](/reading/9780241425428/). Nearly finished the book now.
