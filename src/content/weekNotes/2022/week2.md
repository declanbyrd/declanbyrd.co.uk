According to the my site analytics a grand total of 3 people read my [week notes from last week](https://declanbyrd.co.uk/journal/2022/week1/). This is particularly impressive because I forgot to tweet that I'd started writing weekly notes.

This week I:

- Spent most of my working week developing a new feature and attending work meetings that won't make the national news.
- Played my first basketball game of the new year in a [114-46 win for Worthing D&D against Chichester Knights](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/31514870.html).
- Finished reading [Warcross by Marie Lu](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/306551/warcross/9780241321447.html). Despite being marketed as a children's book, its one of the better science fiction storylines I've read. The sequel, [Wildcard](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/308205/wildcard--warcross-2-/9780241342442.html) has been added to my reading list.
- Started reading [Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir](https://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/project-hail-mary-hc).
- Watched [Brighton and Crystal Palace play out a 1-1 draw at The Amex](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2447704/dominant-albion-have-to-settle-for-point). An important game not to lose and in the end a good result.
- Watched [The Eternals](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9032400/).
- Walked around Lancing Ring. On a clear day there are good views towards Brighton and Worthing.
