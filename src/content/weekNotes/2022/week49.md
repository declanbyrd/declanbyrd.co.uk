description: Making my desk a nicer place to work at and what else I've been up to over the last seven days.

My week started with the arrival of a dual monitor arm that I'd ordered last week. I had to wait until I'd finished working for the day so that I could set it up. I've since spent most of the week moving the monitors around so they're at the correct height and position. It has freed up a lot of additional space on my desk which is great and I noticed that I wasn't slouching while working.

I had a good basketball session this week too. I shot the ball **really** well which is unusual for me, especially given how cold it was in the sports hall. It felt like every time I shot the ball it went in. I tried to avoid taking a break because as long as I kept running I was staying warm. Only one more session now until the new year.

I've been trying to finish the book that I've been reading since September. I set myself the goal of reading 12 books this year but I'm currently on the tenth so I've got some catching up to do. Hopefully I'll finish this book next week and give myself a chance of reading another two books before the year ends.

I haven't spent a lot of time on the PlayStation this week. I played a couple of games of FIFA but didn't spend as much time playing as I have done in previous weeks.

This week was also my last full week of work before the end of the year. I have a four day week next week which I'm excited about.

## What has changed on this site:

- One of the ISBNs that I used in the reading page wasn't being recognised by the API. I changed it by using an ISBN that it is able to recognise and therefore the site builds successfully.

## What I've been reading:

- I read another 6 chapters of [The Apollo Murders by Chris Hadfield](/reading/9780735282353/) this week.

## What I've been watching:

- [Episode 9](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/60625-rick-and-morty/season/6/episode/9) in Season 6 of [Rick and Morty](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/60625-rick-and-morty).
- [Amsterdam (2022)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/664469-amsterdam).
