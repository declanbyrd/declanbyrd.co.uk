I've been spending quite a lot of time on the PlayStation this week. I finished Stray which I really enjoyed. What the game lacked in length, it made up with its storyline and puzzles. I liked that the gameplay kept the controls simple and all the actions were mapped to single buttons and not combinations. Need for Speed: Heat, Star Wars Battlefront 2 and FIFA 23 also got some play time this week.

We had a family meal at [VIP](https://pizzavip.co.uk/) on New Year's Eve. I had a very nice calzone filled with fior di latte cheese, ricotta, mascarpone, black pepper, salami and topped with tomato sauce. 

After the meal, most of us went to the Amex to watch [Brighton lose 4-2 to Arsenal](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/3002690/brave-albion-beaten-by-the-leaders). It wasn't the best performance from the team, but without our first choice midfield pairing in Mac Allister and Caicedo, and some costly mistakes, we struggled to stay in the game. Delighted for Evan Ferguson, scoring his first Premier League goal.

Celebrating the new year is a bit different for me as it's also my birthday. We welcomed in the new year with a brunch, an afternoon of board games and some very nice mini white chocolate and raspberry cheesecakes.

That brings an end to my week notes for 2022. If you've been reading these notes, it's appreciated. I hadn't really thought that people would be reading these notes when I started them back in January but it's helped keep me motivated to keep writing them. Here's to another 52 weeks worth of notes in 2023.
