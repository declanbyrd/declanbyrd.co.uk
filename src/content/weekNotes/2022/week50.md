My week started with a very cold basketball session. The temperature in the sports hall was 1&deg;C and we had more players at the session this week so I had to try and keep warm when I was on the bench. When I was on the court I didn't shoot the ball well and noticed more aches and pains as the session went on. I didn't enjoy this weeks session as much as the session last week.

I finished work for the year on Thursday. I've now got a nice break and don't start work again until January! I'm sure I'll have a list of things I want to achieve and by the end of my break I will have done very few of them.

Becka and I visited Gunwharf Quays for some shopping on Friday. I hadn't been back to Portsmouth since I was at university and we were told that all teaching was going remote due to covid. Gunwharf Quays always felt expensive as a student so it was nice to go back with a slightly bigger budget and come back with a few more things.

It wouldn't be time off work without me spending hours playing video games. I managed to spend most of an afternoon playing seasons mode in FIFA 23, often getting frustrated at the colour contrast between team kits. When the frustration got too much I switched to playing Spider-man and have apparently reached 80% completion of the campaign despite choosing to complete as many of the side missions as possible.

I also watched the world cup final on Sunday. Thrilled to see Brighton's Alexis McAllister play so well and get to lift the trophy!

## What has changed on this site:

- I added my notes for [The Apollo Murders by Chris Hadfield](/reading/9780735282353/).
- I no longer have the book that I'm currently reading included in the collection of books that I finished. If I don't finish the book that I'm currently reading then I don't need to list it with the ones that I did read. It also means that there isn't a page "in draft" if it takes me a long time to finish the book.

## What I've been reading:

- I finished [The Apollo Murders by Chris Hadfield](/reading/9780735282353/) this week!
- I started reading Don't Make Me Think: Revisited by Steve Krug.
