Basketball was a bit more fun this week. Teams were selected before the session started which was different compared to the way they've been selected in previous weeks and as a result talent was more evenly distributed. Court time wasn't dominated by a single team this week and each game was competitive.

I made the trip to the London Stadium to watch [Brighton win 2-0 against West Ham](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2753405/albion-fourth-after-another-great-day-in-the-capital). Away days are always better when your team wins, and Sunday was no exception.
