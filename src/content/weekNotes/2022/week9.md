description: Faster builds, I built a thing and an away win for Worthing D&D.
---

This week I:

- Played for [Worthing D&D's away win against Eastbourne Lions](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/31514879.html) with a final score of 61-98.
- Started reading [The Silmarillion by J.R.R Tolkien](/reading/9780547951980/). I can see why this book is often described as a challenge. I've only read the AinulindalÃ« (the creation story) and the Valaquenta (descriptions of the spirits) so far and had to re-read multiple pages.
- Watched The Grand Budapest Hotel on Disney+.
- Added a now playing section to the home page which shows my last played track from Spotify. I used the new [Netlify Graph](https://www.netlify.com/blog/announcing-netlify-graph-a-faster-way-for-teams-to-develop-web-apps-with-apis) feature to achieve this and definitely want to use it again for more projects.
- Reduced the duration of my builds on Netlify from 9 minutes to 2 and a half minutes by using [netlify-plugin-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netlify-plugin-cache).
- Watched [The Batman](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/414906-the-batman?language=en-GB) at the Dome Cinema in Worthing. Though nearly 3 hours long and the ending somewhat drawn out, the remainder of the film was an enjoyable watch.
