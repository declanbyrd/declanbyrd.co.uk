A rather quiet week this week so shorter notes than usual. Again I had no basketball due to my hand injury which has been very frustrating as it hasn't healed as fast as I had hoped. The sports hall is closed for the next few weeks as it is being used for exams so I'm hoping that I'll be back playing again when the hall is reopened.

I spent a large part of this week writing up how I syndicate my Mastodon posts to create a social media archive. I forgot how empty the notes section of the journal looks at the moment despite spending lots of time syndicating everything back to my site. One day I'll get the hang of sharing things on social media.

In addition to spending a few hours playing career mode in FIFA 23 on the PS5, I was also able to spend a bit of time playing on the Nintendo Switch this week too. Most of the games on my switch are either Nintendo exclusives or ports of games that I hadn't played on previous consoles. Portal 2 was one of the games that I hadn't played before and after the completing the first game a while ago I started the sequel. I can't play it for long periods of time though, jumping through portals for too long gives me motion sickness due to the way the game camera corrects itself.

### What has changed on this site:

- I wrote about how I've [syndicated my Mastodon posts](/journal/2022/mastodon-pesos/) to this site to create a social media archive.
