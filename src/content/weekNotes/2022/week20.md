description: Basketball Sussex men's cup final and a side project.

For the week starting 16th May:

- I played in Worthing D&D's cup final win against Eastbourne Lions. A close game that finished with a final score of 88-105.
- I watched [Brighton's final game of the season, a 3-1 win against West Ham](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2629952/albion-secure-ninth-spot-with-final-day-win-over-west-ham). Fantastic way to end the season and to finish in the top 10 despite "needing a striker" is a sign of just how well coached this team are.
- I've been working on a way to publish notes and bookmarks to this site. I could have used a content-management-system (CMS) for this and provide the CMS a template for each, which would then render both to this site with specified formatting. The issue with that approach is that its another dependency to my site which I don't necessarily need. Eventually it would help me move to a publish on own site and syndicating elsewhere (POSSE) content strategy.
