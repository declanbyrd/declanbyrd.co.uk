description: Limiting my consumption of social media and a sales conference.

Tasked with collecting some customer feedback regarding some of the products my team is developing, I attended an in-person sales conference this week. Thanks to some of the sales team who are significantly better at networking than I am, I didn't spend the entire event standing awkwardly by one of the stands and did manage to get the opinions of some of the attendees. I was able to present my findings to the rest of my team later in the week.

This week I also took steps to cut down on how much I spend on social media. Though I don't share a lot, I do spend a lot of time reading through it all. On my Android phone there are Digital Wellbeing settings that can restrict access to certain apps once they've been open in the foreground for a specific period of time. For some of the biggest offenders like Twitter, I've set a 15 minute timer so that when I've been browsing for longer than 15 minutes I can no longer access the app. As with most of these applications, if I really wanted to use them I could still access them via a web browser after a timer has expired or on another device.
