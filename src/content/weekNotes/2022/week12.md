For the week starting 21st March, I:

- Played (and scored 3 three pointers) in [Worthing D&D's 115-52 win against Angmering GSD](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/31862365.html) in the quarter-finals of the Basketball Sussex Men's Cup. A semi-final fixture against Brighton Cougars is scheduled for next month.

- Have been (re)playing [Assasin's Creed: The Ezio Collection](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/ASSASSIN-S-CREED-THE-EZIO-COLLECTION-2171132.html) on the Nintendo Switch. I played the original games on an old laptop and the remaster definitely brings new life to the games. The controls have been taking some getting used to though because I've only just got used to the layout for the newer Assasin's Creed games that I've been playing on Google Stadia.

- Saw [Royal Blood at the Bournemouth International Centre](https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39816824-royal-blood-at-bournemouth-international-centre?utm_source=46422&utm_medium=partner). With one guitar, a set of drums and a loop pedal it was amazing the sound they were able to generate.
