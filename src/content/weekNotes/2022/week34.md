My basketball session this week was a better test of stamina than in previous weeks. Fast paced games that were finishing with tied scores after 7 minutes meant that "next basket wins" became the most used phrase that evening. I found the intensity of the games quite challenging and struggled to shoot the ball well but made a couple of lay-ups which I was pleased with.

On Wednesday I travelled to the village of Nailsworth to watch [Brighton play Forest Green Rovers in the second round of the Carabao Cup](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2759003/albion-ease-through-in-carabao-cup). The Brighton side consisted of squad players that had limited minutes so far this season and some of the under 21 players. While some players looked sharper than others, Brighton played well and won 3-0. Despite the ground having a reputation for only selling vegan food, I wasn't tempted to try any and instead opted for fish and chips before we got to the ground.

Just the two games of football this week, as I was also at The Amex to watch [Brighton win 1-0 against Leeds United](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2761945/gross-grabs-the-glory-as-albion-climb-to-third/). Some days everything just goes your way and Saturday felt like one of those days. In addition to the result, train journeys to and from the ground were the most relaxed that I can remember, with little queueing. Brighton finished the weekend 4th in the table so very little to complain about there.
