For the week starting 14th February:

- I've been creating a reading page for this site to log the books that I've been reading. Once I've written the notes on the books I've read so far this year and written a piece on how the page works it will appear on this site.

- It was Bruno's 9th birthday. He celebrated with grated cheese and lots of treats.

- I watched Brighton lose 3-0 to Burnley at The Amex. The worst team performance this season but hopefully a learning experience for the younger players in the squad.
