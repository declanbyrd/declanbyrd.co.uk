description: Getting nostalgic about basketball video games and what else I've been up to over the last seven days.

I was back playing basketball this week! Admittedly, I was very rusty and didn't shoot the ball well. I had some kinesiology tape wrapped round the index finger of my right hand which didn't help trying to grip the ball and it needed replacing a couple of times, but it added some support to the tendon that I damaged a few weeks ago. Eventually I just took the tape off which made quite a big difference and my shot improved. My basketball season starts next week so it was good to have a practice after not playing for a while.

On Saturday, I took a trip to the cinema to see [Black Panther: Wakanda Forever](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/505642-black-panther-wakanda-forever). I was sceptical about watching this film and how a sequel can be made without the main actor from the first film, but I really enjoyed the film in the end.

On Sunday, I was at the Amex to watch [Brighton lose 2-1 against Aston Villa](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2907708/mac-allister-scores-after-49-seconds-then-villa-hit-back). Not a great performance in the end but we're still 7th in the table. We looked lost at times and didn't exactly create a lot of chances. Some players looked like they were just trying to survive the 90 minutes so they didn't risk their chances of appearing at a World Cup. I hope Brighton's players do well but I can't really say I'm excited for the World Cup next week.

Most of my gaming this week has been NBA 2K23 on the PS5. This week I discovered that the My NBA mode in NBA 2K23 lets you choose which era you want to start your career mode in. I chose the Kobe era which starts in 2002 and lets you play through to the present day. The reason I got excited about this is that some of the first games I played on the GameCube were [NBA Courtside 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Courtside_2002) and [NBA Live 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Live_2005) so I was able to play with those same players but in a much higher resolution. Pure nostalgia.

## What has changed on this site:

- I now have some real webmentions on this site, so I was able to make some improvements to how they are shown at the end of my writings.
- In light theme, some of the inline code statements had very low colour contrast. I fixed this.
