description: Everything Everywhere All at Once and thoughts on Obi-Wan Kenobi on Disney+.
---

For the week starting 23rd May:

- I watched [Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/545611-everything-everywhere-all-at-once). This is the kind of film that I feel I need to watch more than once to truly appreciate it. Lots of laughs though and well worth a watch.
- I watched the first two episodes of the [Obi-Wan Kenobi series](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/92830-obi-wan-kenobi) on Disney+. Set between the [Revenge of the Sith](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1895-star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith) and [A New Hope](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/11-star-wars), I found the two episodes quite difficult to focus on. Many of the characters shown are also in A New Hope which meant any danger to those characters was easy to dismiss.
- It may look like I only watched TV and movies this week and that is sort of true. I'm hoping to do some more side project work next week when I have some time off.
