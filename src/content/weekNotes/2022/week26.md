title: Week Notes - Week 26

description: Reaching the half way point in 2022, here is what I've been up to over the last seven days.

At the half way point of a level in a Super Mario game there's a checkpoint flag that appears where you can respawn from if things don't go to plan. There's no save point here though, just my notes from the last seven days.

Work this week was a slightly slower pace than normal and most of my time was spent resolving small issues that improve the quality of the application we're developing.

I've encountered a bug in [Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/LEGO-Star-Wars-The-Skywalker-Saga-2157160.html) on my switch that stops me from continuing The Empire Strikes Back so I started looking through other games to play. I downloaded the [Portal: Companion Collection](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Portal-Companion-Collection-2168991.html) and gave myself motion sickness by finishing a play-through of Portal in one sitting.

## What has changed on this site:

- I moved the links for [what I've been reading](/reading/) and [the colophon](/colophon/) out of the footer and into the header. I'm not particularly good at design but this change feels a bit more organised and puts all the navigation items in one place.
- I added `<meta name="generator" content="{{eleventy.generator}}">` to the head of my base template. The generator meta tag helps automated tools determine what static site generator was used to build my site.
- I modified my build commands so that I was no longer using the globally installed version of 11ty and instead use the version I specify in `package.json`.

## What I've been reading:

- I finished reading [The Girl Who Could Move Sh\*t With Her Mind by Jackson Ford](/reading/9780356510446/).
- I started reading [Dark Matter by Blake Crouch](/reading/9781447297581/).
