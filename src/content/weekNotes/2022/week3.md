This week I:

- Watched [Brighton earn a deserved point in their game against Chelsea at The Amex](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2453292/websters-header-bags-albion-another-point-against-chelsea). Some of the best football played this season and showing the strength in depth within the squad while key players were missing.

- Tried out the [Xbox cloud gaming service](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/play). While the library of games only contained a handful of games that I would actually play, I was interested how the streaming technology compares to [Google Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/). I've cancelled the auto-renew of the Xbox cloud subscription and will be sticking with Stadia for the time being.

- Went back to the office for a day to collect some equipment. I don't miss the commute.

- Still reading [Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir](https://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/project-hail-mary-hc). 250 pages in now and there's a lot of science.

- Watched [Brighton come from behind to draw against Leicester at the King Power stadium](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2460221/welbeck-heads-in-again-as-albion-take-deserved-point). On track to break the record for most draws in a season but still only lost 4 times in the league. This team is fun to watch.
