description: A holiday in Bude and what else I've been up to over the last seven days.

A much needed break from work this week as I went on holiday to [Bude](https://www.visitbude.info/) in Cornwall with [Becka](https://twitter.com/becka_louise_). In addition to snacking on pasties, we ate at some great places in Bude, namely [Potters](https://pottersbude.co.uk/), [The Bank at Bude](https://www.thebankatbude.com/) and [La Bocca](https://www.laboccabude.co.uk/). Admittedly I was too busy eating to remember to take any photos of what I ate.

We also took a trip to [Tintagel Castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/tintagel-castle/) which has great views along the coastline but is a bit steep in places. The bridge which was installed in 2019 that connects the mainland and the island does remove a large section of steep climbs. We then had a brief stop at the medieval harbour in [Boscastle](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/boscastle) on our way back to Bude.

## What has changed on this site:

- I added [my photos from our trip to Tintagel Castle](/photos/20220706/).

## What I've been reading:

- I managed a chapter of [Dark Matter by Blake Crouch](/reading/9781447297581/). The past couple of books I've read have had chapters that are at most 10 pages and this one had 30 pages in the first chapter, so finding the time to concentrate for 30 pages is a bit of a challenge.

## What I've been watching:

- [Episode 5 of Ms. Marvel](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/92782-ms-marvel/season/1/episode/5).
- [Episode 3 in Season 2 of Only Murders in the Building](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/107113-only-murders-in-the-building/season/2/episode/3).
- [Episode 8 in Season 3 of The Boys](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/76479-the-boys/season/3/episode/8).
