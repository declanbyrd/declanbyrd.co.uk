description: Mastodon and virtual power plants.

For the week starting 11th April:

- I've been getting started with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). Interested by the prospect of a decentralized social network that is driven by the community as opposed to a single entity, I wanted to see how it compared to the social networks I am currently connected to.
- I read Rob Dodson's article on [the concept of virtual power plants](https://robdodson.me/posts/your-home-is-a-virtual-power-plant/). The concept of switching things off when they're not in use is nothing new, but this automated solution sounds an interesting one.
- I'm still playing Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga on the Nintendo Switch. It's become an easy game to pick up during short breaks.
