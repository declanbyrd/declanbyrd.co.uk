I had another basketball game this week, but didn't win this time. I made a short appearance on the court as [Worthing D&D White lost 88-82 against Worthing D&D Black](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/33593475.html) in a very close game.

I subscribed to PlayStation Plus Extra for a year. Given that I don't really play online multiplayer games, the deciding factor for me was that the subscription gave me access to a catalogue of games that I could play for no additional cost. There were quite a few games in the catalogue that I had bought on Google Stadia but never got around to playing so I'm looking forward to playing those when I get a chance. I got some use out of online multiplayer too, spending most of my weekend playing seasons mode in FIFA 23.

I started to think about visual changes that I want to make to my site before 2023. There are some new pages that I would like to include and doing so would require the navigation to be re-worked which I've wanted to do for a while now. The colophon link for example shouldn't be at the top of each page, it's not that exciting. I've been looking at [Penpot](https://penpot.app/) as an alternative to Figma to help me visualise the changes I want to make. I'm also thinking about creating a snapshot of my website at the end of the year and making this available on a sub-domain so that I retain a visual history of my site.

Not a lot else has happened this week. I've had the football on in the background most days but I'm rapidly losing any remaining interest I had in watching the world cup.
