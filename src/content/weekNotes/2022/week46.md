description: A trip to London, my first basketball game of the season and what else I've been up to over the last seven days.

This week I had my first basketball game of the season. This season I'm playing for [Worthing D&D White](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/team/241860858/327699995.html) and we started the season with a [114-36 win against Horsham Hawks II](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/33593466.html). I finished the game with 4 points (I got fouled shooting a 3 pointer which went in and I made the resulting free throw).

On Wednesday this week, I made my first trip to the Twilio office in London. Being the only member on my development team that is based in the UK, it was a great chance to network with other people. I'd been invited to a social at [Electric Shuffle in Canary Wharf](https://electricshuffle.com/london/location-canary-wharf) where we were split into teams and competed against each other in various games of [table shuffleboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_shuffleboard). I pushed my social anxiety to the limit, and despite finding it hard to approach people while I was in the office, I did have positive and meaningful conversations with some of my colleagues while at the social event. I was very tired for the next couple of days.

I played Spider-man on the PS5 this week and I'm still choosing to finish the side missions before advancing the main story. I can easily spend hours playing so I've mostly been playing this over the weekends.

## What has changed on this site:

- No changes to the site this week.

## What I've been reading:

- I read over 100 pages of [The Apollo Murders by Chris Hadfield](/reading/9780735282353/) during my commute to the office this week. Going to try and commit to finishing the book by the end of the month.
