For the week starting 7th February, I:

- Had no basketball fixtures.

- Spent most of my free time playing through career mode in FIFA 22 and Assassins Creed Syndicate on Google stadia.

- Tried shooting and editing photos in RAW. I'd previously had the output format on my camera set to JPEG and having made the change I can immediately see the advantages. While it does take longer to develop and process each photo, the final images are much more aligned to the desired outcome.

- Started reading Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. I've not really enjoyed the few chapters I've read and since learning about [Orson Scott Card's anti-LGBTQ views](https://www.glaad.org/gap/orson-scott-card) I've been put off reading more of the book.
