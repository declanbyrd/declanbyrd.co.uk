description: End sewage pollution protest, my development day and Worthing D&D win the league title.

For the week starting 18th April:

- I played in [Worthing D&D's 63-89 away win against Angmering GSD](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/31514881.html). With only 1 league game left to play and yet to lose a game this season we claimed the league title.
- I attended the [End Sewage Pollution Protest](https://sas.org.uk/EndSewagePollutionProtests/) in Worthing. Unfortunately, the chant of "What do we want: Southern water to take some responsibility for dumping untreated sewage into rivers and the sea, when do want it: now" was a bit to long and didn't really catch on so instead it was replaced with "what do we want: no more poo". If you shut your eyes at any point you would have thought you were in a future where people were trying to ban their own digestive systems.
- The third Thursday of the month meant I had a personal development day at work. I spent most of the day trying to understand how [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) (a decentralized social media protocol) worked and how it could be used to make a personal site act as a social media feed. I also built some templates in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) so that I could document what I was working on, any blockers and any tasks that I needed to complete that weren't associated to a JIRA item. When it comes to my team's daily stand-up I then have a note for each day with what I need to update the team with and if there any items I need help with.
- I watched [Brighton draw 2-2 against Southampton at The AMEX](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2589569/frustration-as-albion-are-held-by-southampton). Two points dropped in the end after a very fast start. Was also nice to be able to celebrate goals at the Amex, something which has felt very rare this season.
