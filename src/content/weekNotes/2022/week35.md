A frustrating basketball session this week. Occasionally, one player will try to do _everything_ themselves and score all the team's baskets without the input of the remaining four players on their team. I was on a team like that this week and I wasn't the one player trying to break the record for the most consecutive missed shots without passing the ball to another player on their team. Still, I ran around a bit which is better than spending more time sat down.

I've now logged over 85 hours in my attempt to 100% complete [Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga on the Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/LEGO-Star-Wars-The-Skywalker-Saga-2157160.html). I've completed just under 80% of the galaxy which mostly consists of side missions and still have to 100% complete some of the levels too. I managed to play some [Rise of the Tomb Raider](https://stadia.google.com/game/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration) this week too, though it isn't as easy to play for short periods of time.

On Sunday, I was at The Amex to watch [Brighton win 5-2 against Leicester](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2780412/brilliant-albion-hit-five-past-leicester-in-amex-thriller). Alexis Mac Allister scored the best non-goal I've ever seen, followed by one of the best free kicks I've seen at The Amex. VAR contributing 4 minutes to the total of 7 minutes of added time at the end of the second half seemed far too long for something that was supposed to be correcting 'clear and obvious' errors.
