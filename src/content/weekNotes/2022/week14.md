For the week starting 4th April:

- I'm now no longer testing positive for Covid. Sore eyes and the occasional headache remain but otherwise back to normal. Would not recommend getting Covid - 0/10.
- After two negative LFTs on consecutive days, I was able to play for Worthing D&D in their [Basketball Sussex cup semi-final win over Brighton Cougars](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/32121209.html). A very close game in the end with D&D being up by 15 at half-time but Brighton Cougars started the third quarter strong and pulled level going into the fourth quarter. Final score was 85-92.
- I've been playing Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga on the Nintendo Switch. It has a similar open-world feel to the Lego Lord of the Rings game where there were lots of side-quests that would unlock extras but it can get confusing when levels have started and when you're advancing the story in the open world. I've also lost track of the number of times during the Episode 1 story that Qui-Gon Jinn has mentioned that they "have a particular set of skills".
- I started looking at ways to share notes without a dependency on any social media platform. In particular, I've been researching indie web note publishing methods that would allow me to publish (on my) own site once and syndicate elsewhere ([POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE)). Max BÃ¶ck wrote how to [syndicate content to Twitter using Netlify functions](https://mxb.dev/blog/syndicating-content-to-twitter-with-netlify-functions/) which looks a useful resource for when I eventually try to build it for my own site.
