title: What I think about when I think about writing a blog post
description: A non-definitive collection of things that cross my mind when I think about writing a new entry (blog post) for the journal section of my website.

What exactly is it that I'm trying to share on the world wide web? 

I'll just stick my noise cancelling headphones on to help me concentrate while I write this, that way I won't be distracted. If I get this post to under 500 characters that would mean I could just re-write this as a post on Mastodon, finally something that isn't just a link to my latest week notes. I should really use Mastodon more. If I summarise this post to a bullet point it could just go in my next week notes. That might make my week notes look less like a list of content that I've binge watched on various subscription services. Why is there no music coming out of my headphones?

I wonder what other people have written blog posts about. Do I need to add a copyright free image to the top of this post that isn't relevant to the content? If I did I think I'd choose a picture of an Alpaca. 

Is this post any good? How am I defining good? I shouldn't set goals for writing on this site, what would I do if I actually met the goal? I still think my writing peaked when I sent my English homework from school to Blue Peter and they sent me back a [badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter_badge). Why do I need to associate writing with a reward?

Enough overthinking.

I'm struggling to articulate my thoughts because I don't do it enough. It won't improve if I fall into a black hole of self-doubt every time I open my laptop.

I could finish writing this post another day. I could finish it now. Maybe it is already finished?
