This week I:

- Played in [Worthing D&D's 90-70 win over SE Tigers](Worthing D&D's 90-70 win over SE Tigers).
- Upgraded my website to use the recently released [version 1.0 of 11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-one-point-oh/). 
- Replaced the image optimisation on my website with the [11ty image plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/). When I upgraded 11ty, the previous image optimisation plugin stopped working so it felt a good time to replace it.
- Started playing [Humankind on Google Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/store/details/3f40802097224fa1aaa0dcc4555828b7rcp1/sku/569fd572ad0a4bb6b3f1a08237fc69c0p). I was particularly interested in the direct touch controls that meant I wouldn't need to use a controller to play the game on my phone.
- Continued reading [Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir](https://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/project-hail-mary-hc). Didn't manage a lot of reading time this week so only managed to add 100 pages since last week.
