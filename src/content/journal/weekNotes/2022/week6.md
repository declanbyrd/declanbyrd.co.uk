This week I:

- Had no basketball fixtures.

- Spent most of my free time playing through career mode in FIFA 22 and Assassins Creed Syndicate on Google stadia. 

- Tried shooting and editing photos in RAW. I'd previously had the output format on my camera set to JPEG and having made the change I can immediately see the advantages. While it does take longer to develop and process each photo, the final images are much more aligned to the desired outcome.
