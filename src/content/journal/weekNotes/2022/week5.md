This week I:

- Played in [Worthing D&D's 84-67 win over Shoreham Spartans](https://www.basketballsussex.co.uk/match/31584725.html) in the cup.
- Ranked #3 in [11ty leaderboards â„–17](https://twitter.com/eleven_ty/status/1488195108658946055). The leaderboards are created using [Speedlify](https://www.zachleat.com/web/speedlify/) which measures your site's performance over time. I'm rather pleased that I've managed to climb to third but would also be thrilled if I am moved down in the standings. The more sites above mine in the standings, the more people are building fast and accessible websites.
- Finished reading [Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir](https://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/project-hail-mary-hc). Yet to read a book by Andy Weir that I haven't enjoyed.
- Started learning React Native from [Kadi Kraman's Intro to React Native course on Frontend Masters](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/). Interesting learning about the similarities between single-page React applications and React Native ones.
- Watched [Brighton get knocked out of the FA cup in a  3-1 loss against Spurs](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2472917/fa-cup-journey-over-after-defeat-at-spurs). A new ground checked off and a disappointing performance in the end.
