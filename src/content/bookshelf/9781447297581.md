- Like a more science-fiction version of the Midnight Library by Matt Haig.
- One of the chapters was 60 pages so it took a while to find the time to read that chapter in one sitting. Overall, the book took me over two months to read.
- Enjoyed this book, and in addition to already reading Recursion, I'm likely to read more by Blake Crouch in the future.
