summary: "'Brilliant. . . I think Blake Crouch just invented something new.' - Lee ChildFrom Blake Crouch, the author of the bestselling Wayward Pines trilogy, Dark"
details: "  Matter is a New York Times bestselling, relentlessly twisting thriller about how far we'll go to claim the lives we dream of.'Are you happy in your life?'Those are the last words Jason Dessen hears before the masked abductor knocks him unconscious. Before he awakes to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by strangers in hazmat suits. Before the man he's never met smiles down at him and says, 'Welcome back.'In this world he's woken up to, Jason's life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college physics professor, but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something impossible.Is it this world or the other that's the dream? And even if the home he remembers is real, how can Jason possibly make it back to the family he loves? The answers lie in a journey more wondrous and horrifying than anything he could've imagined - one that will force him to confront the darkest parts of himself even as he battles a terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe.From the author of the bestselling 'Wayward Pines' trilogy, Dark Matter is a brilliantly plotted tale that is at once sweeping and intimate, mind-bendingly strange and profoundly human - a relentlessly surprising thriller about choices, paths not taken, and how far we'll go to claim the lives we dream of."

- Like a more science-fiction version of the Midnight Library by Matt Haig.
- One of the chapters was 60 pages so it took a while to find the time to read that chapter in one sitting. Overall, the book took me over two months to read.
- Enjoyed this book, and in addition to already reading Recursion, I'm likely to read more by Blake Crouch in the future.
