details: '  Race. “An exciting journey to an alternate past” Andy Weir, author of The Martian “Nail-biting” James Cameron, writer and director of Avatar and Titanic “Not to be missed” Frederick Forsyth, author of The Day of the Jackal “Explosive” Gregg Hurwitz, author of Orphan X “Exciting, authentic” Linwood Barclay, author of Find You First 1973. A final, top-secret mission to the Moon. Three astronauts in a tiny module, a quarter of a million miles from home. A quarter of a million miles from help. As Russian and American crews sprint for a secret bounty hidden away on the lunar surface, old rivalries blossom and the political stakes are stretched to breaking point back on Earth. Houston flight controller Kazimieras “Kaz” Zemeckis must do all he can to keep the NASA crew together, while staying one step ahead of his Soviet rivals. But not everyone on board Apollo 18 is quite who they appear to be. Full of the fascinating technical detail that fans of The Martian loved, and reminiscent of the thrilling claustrophobia, twists and tension of The Hunt for Red October, The Apollo Murders puts you right there in the moment. Experience the fierce G-forces of launch, the frozen loneliness of Space and the fear of holding on to the outside of a spacecraft orbiting the Earth at 17,000 miles per hour, as told by a former Commander of the International Space Station who has done all of those things in real life. Strap in and count down for the ride of a lifetime.'

- I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would have.
- There seemed to be lots of plot points that the author placed a lot of emphasis on as they happened in real life, but those points added very little to the storyline.
- I was hoping for a more whodunnit style ending based on how it was set up. I felt disappointed at the anti-climactic ending.
