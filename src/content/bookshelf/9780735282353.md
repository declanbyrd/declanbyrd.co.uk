I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would have.

There seemed to be lots of plot points that the author placed a lot of emphasis on as they happened in real life, but those points added very little to the storyline.

I was hoping for a more whodunnit style ending based on how it was set up. I felt disappointed at the anti-climactic ending.
