summary: "'Two years after I killed Blyth I murdered my young brother Paul, for quite different reasons than I'd disposed of Blyth, and then a year"
details: "  after that I did for my young cousin Esmerelda, more or less on a whim. That's my score to date. Three. I haven't killed anybody for years, and don't intend to ever again. It was just a stage I was going through.' Enter - if you can bear it - the extraordinary private world of Frank, just sixteen, and unconventional, to say the least."

- This is one of my dad's favourites so I thought I would give it a read.
- The book really didn't end how I thought it would.
- Some elements of the book are maybe a bit too dark for me to say I enjoyed reading it.
