- Chapter 9 features sections on Mastodon, the Fediverse and self-governing communities.
- I have a much better understanding of how the Internet works at the network layer and the privatisation of that layer. Net neutrality also makes a lot more sense as a result.
- Tech is political and I think this book does a really good job of explaining why.
