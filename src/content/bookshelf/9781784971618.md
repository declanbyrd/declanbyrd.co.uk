- Second book in [The Three-Body Problem](/reading/9781784971571/) series.
- Despite the long chapters, and lack of convenient places to stop between them, I managed to read this in less than a week.
- Found it interesting how characters coped with the burden of being a wallfacer.
- Interested how the final book in the series continues the story.
