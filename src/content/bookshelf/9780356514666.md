summary: "'LIKE ALIAS MEETS X-MEN . . . I LOVED IT!' Maria Lewis on The Girl Who Could Move Sh*t With Her Mind Full of imagination,"
details: "  wit and random sh*t flying through the air, this insane new Frost Files adventure will blow your tiny mind. Teagan Frost might be getting better at moving sh*t with her mind - but her job working as a telekinetic government operative only ever seems to get harder. That's not even talking about her car-crash of a love life . . . And things are about to get even tougher. No sooner has Teagan chased off one psychotic kid hell-bent on trashing the whole West Coast, but now she has to contend with another supernatural being who can harness devastating electrical power. And if Teagan can't stop him, the whole of Los Angeles will be facing the sh*tstorm of the century . . . Praise for the Frost Files series: 'Proceeds at breakneck speed through almost 500 pages of madcap adventure' Guardian 'Fast-paced and a lot of fun to read . . . a modern action movie that just happens to be in book form' The Fantasy Inn 'A drunken back-alley brawler of a book' Robert Brockway, author of The Unnoticeables 'Ford's breakneck pace keeps the tension high, and the thrills coming the whole way through' BookPage 'A fast-paced, high-adrenaline tale' Kirkus"

- Unlike [The Girl Who Could Move Sh*t with Her Mind](/reading/9780356510446/) and [Random Sh*t Flying Through the Air](/reading/9780356510460/) which work as stand-alone stories, this story focuses on the open-ended questions raised in the first two books.
- I feel like this book ["jumped the shark"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark).
