- Unlike [The Girl Who Could Move Sh\*t with Her Mind](/reading/9780356510446/) and [Random Sh\*t Flying Through the Air](/reading/9780356510460/) which work as stand-alone stories, this story focuses on the open-ended questions raised in the first two books.
- I feel like this book ["jumped the shark"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark).
