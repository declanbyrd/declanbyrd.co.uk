- This compliments the Netflix series [The Last Dance](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/79525-the-last-dance?language=en-GB) really well and includes additional detail about Phil Jackson's time as head coach of the Chicago Bulls.
- There's also a lot of insight into Jackson's time in Los Angeles and the comparisons between Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.
- Unlike some other sports autobiographies this book placed a greater emphasis on Phil Jackson's achievements than his life story and doesn't start at his birth and early life.
