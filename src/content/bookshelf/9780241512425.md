- I didn't enjoy this one as much as I enjoyed the first two Thursday murder club books.
- This book felt more focused on one or two of group where the other characters are not as involved.
- I'm not sure if I liked the ending. Lots of build-up for something that I assume is linked to the plot for the next book.
