- I didn't enjoy reading this book. The sidebar sections were a distraction mid-sentence and there were lots of references to previous or future sections of the book.
- There were some interesting points made about the collaboration between humans and AI.
- There seemed to be a greater emphasis on robots than the AI that those robots were using.
