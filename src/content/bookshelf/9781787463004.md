summary: "Over 20 years ago, heiress Patricia Lockwood was abducted during a robbery at her family's estate. Patricia escaped, but so did her captors, and the"
details: "  stolen items were never recovered. Until now. On New York's Upper West Side, a recluse is found murdered in his apartment alongside two objects of note: a Vermeer painting and a leather suitcase bearing the initials WHL3. Windsor Horne Lockwood III, or Win as his friends call him, doesn't know how his suitcase or his family's lost painting ended up in the dead man's home. But he's interested, especially when the FBI tell him that the men who kidnapped his cousin and stole the painting may still be at large. The case has baffled the FBI for decades. But Win has three things the FBI has not: a personal connection to the case, a large personal fortune and his own unique brand of justice."

- I can't remember the last time I read a book in a day, but this one had me hooked.
