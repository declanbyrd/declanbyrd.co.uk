- My biggest frustration with this book was that a lot of the text wasn't accompanied by images. A section on Maradona had four pages of images alone, yet the section on murals outside football stadiums referenced stadiums renound for their atmospheres without showing any of the murals outside their grounds.

- The original Bruno Saltor mural in Brighton made an appearance at the end of the book.
