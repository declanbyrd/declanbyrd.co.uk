- I enjoyed the story.
- I'm unsure of the connection between the X-Men and Madelyne Proyr and the story only covered that they were known to each other.
- There were a few sub-plots that I would like to read more of (e.g. how Ben Reilly came to exist, why Norman Osborne was no longer the green goblin, and the hobgoblin story).
