- I bought this book while I was in my final year of university, but I didn't get around to reading it.
- It felt more like an academic paper than a book due to the number of references to external sources and references to other chapters.
- I learned a lot, particularly the development of the Linux kernel and Herd.
- I found the book quite challenging to read.
