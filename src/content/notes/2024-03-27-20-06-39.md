Added a new snippet to my VS Code snippets file today so that I can add an ISO 8601 date and time to the front-matter of my markdown files after I've finished writing.

```json
{
        "postDate": {
		"prefix": "now",
		"body": ["$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-${CURRENT_DATE}T$CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:$CURRENT_SECOND$CURRENT_TIMEZONE_OFFSET"],
		"description": "Inserts the current date and time in ISO 8601 format."
	}
}
```
