    <h2 >Hi, I'm Declan.</h2>
    <p>I'm a software engineer specialising in front-end web development. Having recently graduated from the University of Portsmouth with a Bsc in Software Engineering, I'm now working at Honeywell where I previously interned for a year as part of my degree.</p>

    <p>When making this site, I've tried to make it WCAG AA compliant using the <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/">checklist</a> from the <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com">A11y Project</a> as reference. While every effort has been made to make this site WCAG AA compliant, if you find any aspect that does not meet those standards then please reach out and I will resolve the issue.</p>
