I'm working as a software engineer at Twilio.

I'm documenting what I do each week in the form of [week notes](/journal/tags/week-notes/).

School sports halls are no longer being used for exams, so I'm back playing basketball twice a week until the season starts in October.

I built and published an [Eleventy plugin to fetch Mastodon posts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive). There's a live demo of it in use on the [journal page](/journal/notes/).
