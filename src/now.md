I'm working as a software engineer at Twilio.

I'm documenting what I do each week in the form of [week notes](/journal/tags/week-notes/).
The basketball season is over and the school halls are being used for exams. I've tried to take up running until pre-season starts.

I built and published an [Eleventy plugin to fetch Mastodon posts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive). I'm focusing on improvements I can make to the onboarding process and making more post data available through the plugin.
