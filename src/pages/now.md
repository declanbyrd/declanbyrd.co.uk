I'm working as a software engineer at Twilio.

I'm documenting what I do each week in the form of [week notes](/journal/tags/week-notes/).

I'm playing basketball for Worthing D&D White in the Basketball Sussex league and cup competitions. We're currently in the semi-finals of the plate competition but sit bottom of the men's first division.

My thoughts lately have been around the anatomy of notes, information architecture, and how much information it is possible to consume in a lifetime.
