I'm working as a software engineer at Twilio.

I'm documenting what I do each week in the form of [week notes](/journal/tags/week-notes/).

I'm playing basketball for Worthing D&D White in the Basketball Sussex league and cup competitions.

In my spare time, I've been developing a site that would help me to publish updates to this website. So far, short notes that can be syndicated to Mastodon and reading updates are the features that I have been building.

I recently built and published an [Eleventy plugin to fetch Mastodon posts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-mastoarchive). There's a live demo of it in use on the [journal page](/journal/notes/).
