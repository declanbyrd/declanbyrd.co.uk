I'm currently having some time off before I start a new role. Prior to this, I worked at Honeywell where I contributed to the development of building management systems.

In my free time, I can be found following [Brighton & Hove Albion](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/), playing basketball for [Worthing D&D](https://www.danddbasketball.co.uk/) and playing single player video games.
