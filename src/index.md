I'm currently a software engineer at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/). Prior to this, I worked at [Honeywell](https://buildings.honeywell.com/us/en/home) where I contributed to the development of building management systems. With this being my personal site, it should be noted that all views here are my own and do not represent the views of my employer.

In my free time, I can be found following [Brighton & Hove Albion](https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/), playing basketball for [Worthing D&D](https://www.danddbasketball.co.uk/) and playing single player video games.
